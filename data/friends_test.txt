What I’ve been craving most during quarantine - a perfectly made Aviation. It’s the holy grail of beverages. Poor quality creme de violet and it tastes like a Gap Body candle circa 1995. If even one ingredient is out of balance, the entire flavor profile collapses. Can not wait to sit at a bar again - this will be the first thing I order! 
Do you ever think about where bar tools get their names? The Yarai is named for a traditional Japanese weaving pattern and its thought to make the glass easier to hold. And legend has it sailors named their liquor allotment a “jigger” after the jiggermast  - the smallest mast on the ship. 
My biggest pet peeve - disparaging sweet. When did sweet become so “uncool”? Whether it’s Sauternes or Spatlese, the American palate needs to get hip to the purpose of residual sugar. Any cook will tell you that the secret to balancing out the acid in homemade marinara sauce is a spoonful of sugar - that principal is universal!
ready-to-drink Cutwater Lime Margarita can from San Diego, CA. When there’s a pandemic and you’re on a budget, try this refreshing yet far too sweet “margarita” with “natural lime, orange, and triple sec flavors”. It’s not cloying but it’s syrupy enough to recall 18 year old concoctions of vodka, roses green bottle syrup, and Mountain Dew Code Red. I’m not sure what “orange and triple sec flavors” means and I’m sure that I don’t want to know. What I do know is that it’s 12.5%abv in a can and what’s wrong with that. You also know it’s Becky-basic because it states that it is gluten free two times on the can.

Chemarin Beaujolais Nouveau 2018 full of tart red currants, dried strawberries and bougie fruit roll up from Yes! Organic Market. It’s super juicy and has a lip-smacking zing that excites and compels me to find other nouveaus that’s don’t just taste like the bubblegum flavor of fluoride from a doctors office. It’s a little natty, like the essence of dried leaves on the ground from harvest time were also trapped in the bottle. 
Let’s make a Negroni! Step one - pull the Campari and the Beefeater from the freezer. Yes they bunk together for easy swig-convenience. You can put as much as you want in your mixing glass, just make sure it’s equal parts with sweet vermouth that better come out of your fridge and not a cupboard where it’s been open and forgotten for ages. Add ice and stir, strain into a rocks glass and add a fancy cube and express an orange peel. Please don’t burn it with your lighter and put it in the drink. No one wants your petrol-tasting garnish. Chuck it in the bin where it belongs.
I’m inky and sticky tasting of an ashtray of Newports, tar, and spoiled black bean soup. Everyone takes me a shot to show just how hip they are. What am I?
This gem smells a bit like a gas station but the citrus notes and residual sugar makes it taste more like lemonade than chugging from an oil can. Beyoncé of Rieslings.

No it’s not a snow globe, that’s a Pet Nat. Hello sediment!
God, Karen. You can be so reductive.
Who says you can’t drink your artichokes? Say hello to Cynar.
What is that smell? Its like a dirty horse barn! Don’t worry. It’s just my St. Joseph.
