21,cocktails,"I made a giant batch of aquafaba (egg white substitute made out of bean water) for unrelated stupid reasons, and needed to get rid of it somehow. So why not in a cocktail that calls for egg white?

My first attempt with a pisco sour was a pretty significant failure, so I decided to up the stakes:

The original Filibuster recipe is:

- 1.5 oz whisky, ideally Canadian but Irish or rye will be just as good

- 3/4 oz lemon juice

- 1/4 oz maple syrup, ideally grade A dark from Quebec or Vermont

- 1 egg white

- 1 dash Angostura

Since I got weak foaming action from the aquafaba last time, I doubled the volume (using 1 ounce) and really put my shaker to work: 1 minute shaking just the aquafaba, then a 20 second dry shake with the rest of the ingredients, then a 20 second wet shake. You can see that it foamed up spectacularly, and 1/2oz would probably have been enough.

The head is beautiful and stable, but IMO egg white works better flavor-wise. The aquafaba head sits on top of the drink and does not integrate with it at all. It doesn't contribute to the texture or the flavor like the egg white does (but at least it does not taste like beans).",1587243199

39,cocktails,"Four suggestions: 

(1) It sounds like from your description that you‚Äôre using a sugar cube or straight sugar and counting on it to dissolve. Instead, try some simple syrup (1:1 water/sugar, heated until dissolved). The syrup distributes more easily in the drink giving you a more consistent sweetness throughout. Start with 1/4oz and scale up or down from there to match your taste.

(2) Water matters. Make sure your stirring sufficiently to get some good dilution before serving. You want that water, it‚Äôs a good thing.

(3) Try playing around with the amount of bitters you‚Äôre using. It might seem counterintuitive but more bitters (2-3 hard shakes) can actually be really helpful in balancing. Again, play with this to your taste.

(4) Don‚Äôt skip the garnish. An orange or lemon twist (peel expressed over the drink and rubbed on the rim to get that magical citrus oil) can also make a huge difference. Taste is overwhelmingly based on smell and getting that big dose of citrus everyone you put your nose in the drink can add some terrific balance.

Hopefully that gives you a place to start!",1587241061

53,cocktails,"So in Germany we have one of the oldest &amp; probably best ""Obstbrand""  (= eau de vie, one of the reasons America also uses ""Kirschwasser"" as a word in recipes I guess) tradition with a lot of high end bars getting more and more into it with the modern trend (just as in top cuisine) to go regional and the regional producers creating great new stuff also with the intention to use it in cocktails and some even advertising it with that. Bought this week something I never saw before even with this trend: a pineapple eau de vie (from a small producer in Rhineland Palatinate, ""Vierhasen""). By itself it's really dry and has interesting green notes, probably the leaves and skin of the pinapple is used too and the real great flesh of the fruit coming through in the finish especially, sitting on your teeth like you really just ate it and have to look for some fibers between your teeth, lol.   
Needed surprisingly low amount of trials for this first one, I knew from the beginning I wanted to go for a strong, dry, yet elegant drink that mixes dry pineapple and exotic notes (but not the savoury-sweet-sour ones from tiki) with middle &amp; northern european herbs.  
The Linie Aquavit (standard Sherry Cask version) is perfect for this since it's really mellow from the casks but still gets you the nice herbal notes, I though of using white rum or pisco first but quickly settled with this. I love falernum and it also matches with it's sour (enhances the pineapple flavour) spicy notes, just as the famous Black Lemon bitters from Scrappy's.  
After settling on aquavit I also immediately knew I want to put some salt in it and to underline the eau de vie just a slight portion of Giffard pineapple, just to get some more fruit.

The balance of sweet-sour is perfect from the liqueur and falernum, the falernum I used (Belle Booze Falernum) is also local from a cocktail boutique operated by a nice local bar, it's produced just days before you buy it and has the best ingredients but is also way more sour than your John D. Taylor's (which is basically a sirup and not a liqueur to me) so you would need to adjust with some lime juice if you use other falernum here.  
The last thing was the sesame oil to get a nice dry, slightly nutty aroma while drinking, matching the dried pineapple and pineapple skin aroma.   
Name = Oslo (Linie Aquavit), San Jos√© (Costa Rica is the biggest pineapple exporter)  
Funfact: Pineapple is my favourite fruit since my early childhood.

So after reading all of this: Probably not a drink you can just quickly make at home because of some ingredients, sorry, haha but wanted to share anyways.

* 1.5 oz Botanist Gin
* 1 oz Rose Liqueur
* 1 oz Rose Water
* 0.75 oz Gomme Syrup
* 0.5 oz Lemon Juice

The star for me was the gomme syrup, this was my first attempt at it myself and I really didn't expect the mouthfeel to make so much difference. I think it had extra effect considering this drink's namesake. I wish I had some rose petals, or powdered sugar to garnish/rim with. I considered some chocolate but my preference for turkish delight goes against the chocolate coating.

Mixel has a ""bar"" to stock with whatever ingredients you have and will show you recipes that you can make based on the % of the ingredients that you have. You can add multiple ""bar"" ingredient lists.

It has multiple recipe lists pulled from books like Smugglers Cove, Death &amp; Co, Regarding Cocktails. They also add in recipes on a regular basis. I think theres about 2,000 recipes in there right now.

It has many different filters you can set up, a bookmarking, favoriting and tagging system.  

It offers suggestions for substitutions for ingredients you do not have.

It has a ""Maximizer"" function to list ingredients you dont have based on how many more recipes it will open up for you if you buy them.

The Ui works well, but the retro 8 bit look are an acquired taste.

Idk, I paid for Mixel ""premium"" (basically recipe packs) because its been so useful to me. No other app has come close, including the handful of people trying to launch cocktail apps in here over the past few months.

161,cocktails,"Hey everyone! I wanted to share an idea I‚Äôve been brainstorming, but figured the best way to start is with a cocktail:

New York Sour:

-	1oz Woodford Reserve Bourbon
-	1oz Woodinville Straight Rye Whiskey
-	1oz fresh lemon juice
-	.5oz demerara syrup (1:1)
-	.25oz simple syrup (2:1)
-	1 egg white
-	dry red wine (Spellbound Petite Syrah)

Combine all ingredients, excluding wine, into a shaking tin and shake vigorously with ice. Double strain cocktail into a fresh tin and repeat shake with no ice (reverse dry shake). Serve in a large coup glass and float red wine using a bar spoon.

With the global current events causing many to quarantine, I‚Äôve found myself searching for new hobbies, one being streaming.

Also the same issues and themes come up throughout. You can kind of go through the healing journey with her if you listen to it all in order. The early albums are angry and sad. The later ones are much lighter with just hints of anger and bitterness coming through. If you‚Äôve ever experienced traumas you‚Äôve needed to work through, you can hear that process.

This is inspired by [Jerry Thomas' black tea and ruby port punch](https://www.splendidtable.org/recipes/black-tea-port-milk-punch) - I used similar proportions but made substitutions, and I think the result packs a bigger punch (heh) in terms of flavor. 

* 2 cups strongly brewed black tea
* 2/3 cup Appleton Estate Reserve
* 2/3 cup dry white wine
*  1/3 cup lemon juice
* 160 g rosemary-infused simple syrup (sorry I switched up the units on you!)
* 10 muddled blackberries

414,cocktails,"This week's Will It Booze was ambitious to say the least. I didn't know if it would work until it was done and I have to say, Yes! It will booze!

To make it, I used a carton of fresh strawberries and a package of fresh basil. Remove the leaves and cut the strawberries into pieces. Alternate these in a jar with layers of basil leaves. Pour 2c of 151 vodka into the jar,
 and let sit for 3 days, shaking occasionally. 

The balsamic syrup was a bit of trial and error. I started off with too much vinegar, so I had to keep taking some out and adding more water, etc. In the end, it's about 1c sugar, 1/8 cup of balsamic vinegar, and 3 7/8c water. Combine and heat until the sugar is dissolved, but don't let it get too thick. 

Strain the infused vodka and mix in the cooled syrup before filtering it into a clean jar or bottle. 

This ended up being really well balanced. You can taste each of the components without one completely overpowering the others. Because it's so complex, though, you can't add a lot of new flavors to it in a drink. I kept it simple, muddling a strawberry with some sugar and lemon juice, added 2oz of SBB and ice, shake and strain into a highball glass and fill with soda.",1587163598

I got my Cream of Coconut recipe from the website Art of Drink [https://www.artofdrink.com/ingredient/cream-of-coconut-recipe](https://www.artofdrink.com/ingredient/cream-of-coconut-recipe)

**To make Cream of Coconut:**

Get a can of full fat coconut milk, put it in a pot with a roughly equal amount of sugar, add a pinch of salt and 1/8 tsp vanilla if you wish. Heat gently until the sugar is dissolved and the coconut fat is incorporated. Add 3/4 oz vodka if you want to fortify it. Let cool and bottle.

**To make the ice for the drink:**

Measure your glass to asses how much liquid will fit when it is tilted on its side, for me this was 110 ml

Mix 70 ml water

30 ml cream of coconut

10 ml Campari

Put your glass in the freezer and tilt it, making sure its stable and pour in your coconut mixture and let freeze.

**For the drink:**

1.5 oz Appleton Estate Signature Blend Rum.

.5 oz Cream of Coconut.

.5 oz Green Chartreuse.

.5 oz Lime Juice

Shake, pour into your prepared glass, garnish with a lime wheel

&amp;#x200B;

**If you are making the drink without the fun ice, do this:**

1.5 oz Appleton Estate Signature Blend Rum

1 oz Cream of Coconut

.5 oz Green Chartreuse

.5 oz Lime Juice

Shake and strain over crushed ice, garnish with a mint sprig

You can then add some sugar and spices, put a lid on it, avoid exposure to sunlight and keep it closed for however long you can resist trying it out. You don't necessarily need to wait months, but definitely at least a week or so, and usually the longer the better.

  


The possibilities with this are damn near endless depending how much you want to play with fruits, sugar and spices, and then some more ..

Think spiced wine but with rum, and oh so much better.

  


The beauty of this besides how delicious it tastes is that it doesn't need refrigeration (avoid hot temp though), lasts a while, doesn't have to contain a lot of sugar (if you're drinking that for a whole month), and can even be used to create other cocktails (I've yet to see a version of this that doesn't play well with coconut milk for instance)",1587152297

495,cocktails,"Hi, UK based here too!

Working out what are ‚Äògood bottles‚Äô is a tricky one - I‚Äôve brought lots of so so ones over time but also discovered gems.

I used to be asked a lot what was needed to make cocktails and came up with the below lists (and my recommended entry price bottles) - I would vouch for all those bottles being good enough to make cocktails.

Clear bottle bar:

- Vodka - Smirnoff
- Gin - Gordons
- Tequila - El Jimador Blanco
- Triple sec - Cointreau
- White rum - Havana Club 3
- Grenadine - JR Phillips
- Sugar syrup - Monin
- Dry vermouth - Dolin

Brown bottle bar:

- Bourbon - Buffalo Trace
- Rye - Bulleit
- Cognac - Courvoisier VS
- Sweet Vermouth - Martini Rosso
- Bitters - Angostura, Regans, Peychauds
- Absinthe - Absente (mainly because they do small bottles)
- Campari
- Coffee liqueur - your choice (I make my own that is similar strength to Mr Blacks etc)

With the clear bottle bar, you make a good number of cocktails with citrus juice and mixers.

The brown bottle bar isn‚Äôt quite as versatile but is more to my taste, it does enable you try out some stirred drinks (and some choices combine with the clear bottle bar to expand it).",1587148807

Like you mentioned, Maraschino and Cointreau (or Pierre Ferrand dry curacao) are a good option. I‚Äôd also buy a decent tequila, some blended scotch and an overproof rum if you like tiki drinks.

3‚ÅÑ4 oz Batavia Arrack

3 dasn Mole Bitters

Stir with ice, strain into a cocktail coupe, and garnish with a cherry.

Inspired by the Right Hand at Milk &amp; Honey and riffs like the Tres Hands, I decided to create a Genever and Batavia Arrack variation that I dubbed the Dutch Hand. The Dutch besides distilling Genever are major importers of Batavia Arrack dating back to the Dutch East India Trading Company and now with rum merchants like E&amp;A Scheer. Moreover, the combination of Genever and Batavia Arrack was one that worked well in two drinks that I have had in the past. Over all, quirky and complex. Genever puts it somewhere between a Negroni and a Boulevardier and the Batavia Arrack close to a Right Hand all in the same glass.

76,cocktails,"Rum! And with all the variation, there really isn't just one that can represent the category. 

Here are some of my starter recommendations... 

A lightly aged ""white"" rum like Flor de Cana 4 year, Plantation 3 Star or Havana Club 3 year - but only if you're outside the US. Despite the name, the HC available in the states is crap. Great for daiquiris, mojitos and anything else with a light rum base. 

A nice Jamaican with a bit of funk and flavour like Hampden Estate, Appleton and especially Smith and Cross which go great in Mai Tais and a heap of other tiki drinks.

An unaged agricole blanc, which is made from cane juice instead of molasses, like Clement premier cane or cane blue, Rhum JM or Dillon - really anything from Martinique is a great starting place. These are good for split base Mai Tais, Ti Punch and they make incredible daiquiris as well.

And anything at all from Foursquare out of Barbados or La Maison &amp; Velier which sources rum from distilleries all around the world. Anything put out by those guys is usually fantastic and incredibly well made. 

If you want to go further down the rabbit hole, check out the Smuggler's Cove book by Martin and Rebecca Cate - they do a good job breaking down the category, give lots of recommendations and the recipes are amazing.",1587137827

A good-quality plain orange liqueur - Cointreau is the best in my opinion.

A plain gin like Tanqueray- in my opinion, Tanqueray 10 is too citrus-y for many cocktails

Some herbal liqueur - one of the chartreuses, or Benedictine.

[this site](https://www.cocktailsafe.org/fat-washing.html) was one I found during the process and I think it has some good general guidelines. But letting it sit at room temp for a few hours (which most recipes recommended) didn‚Äôt seem to be problematic - and I remember growing up in a southern household with a jar or tin of bacon grease sitting next to the stove at room temp all the time (even though I now keep my bacon grease in the fridge). I also think ‚Äúuse within a few days‚Äù is probably a little aggressive. I made mine and kept it in the freezer for a few weeks and it was just fine.

Realistically you could probably keep it at room temp. You‚Äôre filtering out the fat and just keeping the bourbon with whatever flavors are imported into the alcohol. I‚Äôm not 100% on how long whatever those flavors are stay good or if they spoil at all (maybe someone who knows the chemistry better than me would know), but I can‚Äôt imagine that the small amounts in there would go bad too quickly in the freezer.

Super easy too.

1.	Cook bacon
2.	put bacon grease in big mason jar

4.	add lid and shake well
5.	let sit at room temp for a few hours
6.	put in freezer/fridge for a few more hours for the fat to continue separating and hardening
7.	remove fat cap
8.	strain remainder (i use a strainer+ cheesecloth)

A few disclaimers:  
- I am not a bartender, I just like playing with recipes... Though I usually focus more on baking.  
- I know a French 75 is normally in a champagne glass but as much as I love malort, it just felt wrong putting it in a champagne glass.  
- Technically to follow the naming convention it should be Chicagoan 75 but that doesn't have quite the same ring to it.


1oz gin   

1 oz malort  

.5 oz simple syrup  

1 oz grapefruit juice

445,cocktails,"I don't go too overboard with my pairing consideration. If I wanted to drink a gin and tonic or a Last Word or something in that ballpark with citrus flavors; I would be choosing a medium bodied cigar, which that Man O'War Puro Authentico Habano is to me. If I wanted to have a peaty Scotch, or a high proof bourbon or rye, or maybe wanted a Sazerac or Manhattan, I would generally choose a more full bodied cigar. It goes both ways; sometimes I pick the cigar first, sometimes the drink. 

There are no rules as long as you can still enjoy both things. For example, if I poured a Bruichladdich Port Charlotte; I wouldn't light a Connecticut wrapped cigar, to me, it would just disappear against a strong Scotch

With all that said; the Amaro Toro is made with Calabrian chilis and really has some bite to it. The first few draws after each sip stoked that little fire on my tongue. I mentioned in another post that next time I make the drink, I'll likely cut the Amaro portion in half with some Grand Marnier or Curacao, I felt it could use a little sugar and a little less heat; but it's genuinely the only spicy drink I've ever liked.",1587073520

Muddle orange slices, brown sugar, and your Black Walnut bitters.  
Whiskey/bourbon/brown liquor(rum might be too sweet)
A lil disarrono(a personal fave and adds the sweetness I like)

Fill glass with ice

You can get weird and add fizzy water and it mimics stumptown‚Äôs coffee sodas 
You can get weird and add kahlua and it‚Äôs kinda like a White Russian.

Good luck!!!!!

It is this reason that i think it is important to teach the ""Why"" of cocktails and reactionary bias. People have different tastes and are more idiosyncratic than ""I've liked X will I like Y?""

Personally, the best tool I've come across was Arnold's Liquid Intelligence spreadsheet of acids and sugars within ingredients. It's not a foolproof plan but it gives you a baseline when you're tasting different spirits/syrups/liquers and your idea of sweetness vs dryness doesn't 100% line up with whats been written down.

Purposefully make the recipe wrong in one direction, Does adding more sugar make thing undrinkable? How much is too much? What about favoring the balance more towards acidity? Can I enhance or detract flavors by adding an aged spirit or by removing it?

There is never going to be an end all be all for a cocktail recipe. The best that you can do is experiment and refine to your preference and be able to back it up with rigorous, but subjective, testing.",1587030308

Hmm...Campari... It's hard to sneak it into a drink undetected. Most recipes feature campari prominently which makes it difficult. I would recommend another tiki variant like the Jungle Bird.

.5 orgeat,

For the sweet vermouth, try this:

1.5 brandy

1.5 sweet vermouth

.75 lemon

.75 cinnamon syrup/honey syrup (your choice)

366,cocktails,"Coconut cream and coconut milk are very different things.

**Coconut cream**: Coconut cream is thick and rich. It is made from simmering four parts shredded coconut in one part water, and then straining out the coconut solids. The resulting liquid is left to separate and the thick, semi-solid coconut cream is scraped off of the top. The cream that rises to the top of a can of coconut milk is also considered coconut cream. 

**Coconut milk**: Coconut milk has the liquid consistency of cow‚Äôs milk and is made from simmering one part shredded coconut in one part water, and then straining out the coconut solids. This is what you use most often in Thai cooking. 

But, as /u/JohnTeaGuy said, you can skim the cream off the top of a can of coconut milk and use that.  Don't shake the can before opening.

Try this simple recipe:
 
**Pi√±a Colada**

* 3 oz (or 3 parts) pineapple juice
* 1 oz (or 1 part) rum
* 1 oz (or 1 part) coconut cream

Blend in a blender and pour into a chilled glass.  If you don't have a blender, you can also shake the heck out of it until it's smooth.",1587010612

So many wrong assertions and bad techniques in this video:

1) All vodka is gluten-free. All of it. Every brand. Tito‚Äôs was simply the first to market themselves as gluten-free.

2) The vermouth-free martini is going *out* of style and has been for a decade and a half at least. Any top-flight cocktail bar in the world is going to use vermouth in their martinis unless the customer requests its absence.

3) _Four_ ounces of vodka?

4) Shaking a martini is, like the vermouth-free martini, on the wane.

5) If you are going to shake a martini, there‚Äôs nowhere near enough ice in that shaker.

6) That‚Äôs a pretty limp and short shake.

Flavors shown: plain, black tea, lavender, basil, rosemary and sage, cinnamon, and spicy (cardamom, cinnamon, allspice, star anise, clove). 

The basic method: 
Yesterday I made up a quart of gomme water for lack of a better term. For every 3/4 cup of hot water add 1/4 cup of acacia powder, and whisk until mostly smooth. You don‚Äôt need to make the day before but at least a couple of hours ahead. 

For each flavor, I made a rich simple 3/4 cup water and 1.5 cups sugar. Add whatever flavor you want, and brink to a simmer for about 5 min. Add 1/2 cup of the gomme water and simmer for another 5 min. The only one I kept the flavor agents in was the spicy blend, so they could keep infusing. You don‚Äôt want to leave fresh herbs in the containers. The one time I tried that with a simple syrup it molded within a couple of weeks.

Reminds me of a drink me and my girl enjoyed for the first week of quarantine (in the pic). 

In whatever vessel you choose to serve it in (mine was a double thus the beer chalice) 1/2 rim w/ tajin and muddle 1-2 over ripe strawberries with .25oz simple.

‚Ä¢ 3-4 slices Serrano pepper, to taste (muddled)
‚Ä¢ 1 oz like juice
‚Ä¢.75 triple sec
‚Ä¢ 2 oz blanco tequila (we used cazadores this batch)

I‚Äôd recommend shaking for around 15 seconds on a sidecar to get a fair amount of dilution and a nice chilled drink.

If you were to remake this with fresh lemon instead of lime you‚Äôd see less of a froth on top, conversely, ant drinks made with pineapple juice will froth up even more than lemon when shaken, different juices can react really differently to each other when aerated even if they all fall into the same citrus category!

58,cocktails," Hello everyone! Bit of a novice here, but have been making gallons of Roderick Weaver/Husk‚Äôs Light Dragoon as a clarified milk punch to help combat these quaran-times. The recipe follows Sean Brock‚Äôs book Heritage faithfully, besides a difference in choice of liquor and an obvious change in scale:

\-32 oz Black Tea (4 TBLS of loose leaves or 6 bags)  
\-1 cup Raw Sugar   
\-6.4 oz of Lemon Juice (roughly 6.5 lemons, double strained)  
\-38 oz VSOP Brandy (I use Deville due to its low cost to volume ratio)  
\-8.5 oz Barbados Rum (Plantation 5 year)   
\-3 oz Peach Brandy  
\-6 Lemon Peels (enhance that flavor!) 

\-20 oz Whole Milk

Notes:

I brew my tea on the stovetop using loose leaves. After the tea is brewed and steeped, I dissolve the sugar and add in the strained lemon juice. I let that cool in the fridge for up to 20 mins before adding the liquor and lemon peels. 

The cocktail is then strained and slowly poured into the milk which has been sitting at room temp for 20 mins. I tried both hot and cold milk and found that in my kitchen, room temp yielded the best results. (For the sake of the argument, since my kitchen can‚Äôt be replicated, I recommend cold milk over hot. Due to the amount of tea and lemon juice this bad boy will definitely curdle well.)

As for straining: as with all of my other punches, this passes through 9 filters, 5 times with 70% of the curdles removed half way through. When bottled, it passes through an additional 2 filters.",1586974942

171,cocktails,"They won‚Äôt outright negate each other, but it might be worth stepping back and thinking about why you want to milk wash a drink that‚Äôs already been fat-washed. Part of the issue here is that even though they have very similar names, milk washing and fat washing are actually fundamentally different processes. 

In fat-washing, you‚Äôre using your booze to ‚Äòwash‚Äô the fat, which strips flavour compounds and other molecules from the fat and deposits them in the booze. At the end of the process you throw out the baby and keep the bathwater, as it were, because what you want to keep is the ‚Äòdirt‚Äô.

Milk washing is the opposite: you‚Äôre washing your booze in milk, which strips out parts that are maybe a bit harsh or objectionable. At the end of the process you throw out the bathwater and keep the baby, because what you want is a nice clean baby. (You‚Äôre also adding lactose and whey and so on, so this analogy kind of breaks down here.) 

So if you were to take the (deliciously) dirty bathwater from your fat wash, then milk wash it, you might not lose all of that flavour and texture, depending on what you started with, but you‚Äôre bound to lose some. I can think of a few examples where it might work‚Äîyou have a fat that is very pungent and needs to have its aromatic edges smoothed off some‚Äîbut as a process it would have limited uses.",1586959902

I made this one ""perfect"" (not tryna brag, just meaning equal parts sweet &amp; dry vermouth) which dials back the sweetness and made me feel okay about adding a bunch of olives which was tbh my goal.

It sounds a bit weird but it ended up as this very punchy blend of bitter/sweet/savory and it was surprisingly balanced.

**Recipe:**

* 1.5 oz campari-style liqueur
* .75 oz sweet vermouth
* .75 oz dry vermouth
* lemon twist
* meaty green olives (like queen or castelvetrano)

363,cocktails,"I think everyone here hit a lot of good points. I also lived with an alcoholic girlfriend years and reassured concerned friends and family that a stocked cabinet does not make an alcoholic, loss of control is what makes an alcoholic.

Therefore I made a deal with a couple of them that if I start display the behaviors of an alcoholic such as: drinking until losing conciseness, becoming violent while drinking, driving while drunk, needing alcohol to ""self medicate"" stress or anxiety, gaps in memory, if I get into the habit of apologizing for my behavior while drinking, or generally prioritize alcohol and being drunk over other adult responsibilities, at that point, I would appreciate them calling me out.

2 dashes angostura bitters 

Two Amarena cherries 

Ice 

I mixed the whiskey and persimmon syrup in a tall glass with a spoon and then poured it over the ice cube. Then I added bitters, stirred more, and added the cherries. These are estimated measurements, mostly mixed to taste. To make persimmon syrup I started with a 1:1 simple syrup (one cup of sugar dissolved in one cup of water) on the stove and then added about a cup of dried persimmon slices. I followed the method I use for ginger syrup and let this mixture boil lightly at the edges of the saucepan, then let is simmer for 15 minutes and finally let it infuse for an hour off the stove, covered. I strained the syrup and keep in in a jar in the fridge. It turned out a little less fruity than I was hoping for but it goes nicely with the kavalan.

Recipe:

Absinthe rinse a chilled Old Fashioned glass, ensure it's really covered then discard excess,

Add:
50ml Rye Whiskey (I used Lot 40),
20ml Barrel Aged Gin (I used Double Barreled by Cotswold),
5 dashes Angostura Bitters,
1/3 tsp Agave Nectar

Mix thoroughly in glass,

Garnish with piece of lemon rind (remove the pith)

Enjoy!

The gin I used was an independent bottling from That Boutique-y Gin Company which was aged in ex-bourbon and ex-red wine barrels.

This is a variation of the Old Fashioned that's bursting with complexity. There's spice from the Rye, a dryness from the gin, some fruitiness from the gin, a suggestion of aniseed from the Abinsthe Rinse that's supported by the bitters, and sweetness from the Agave that pulls it together and stops it from being too dry or astringent.

I suppose it's also somewhat similar to a Sazerac, containing Rye, bitters and an absinthe rinse. 

A bold experiment, but one that's paid off! Give this a try if you've got similar ingredients to hand.

I only had Wray and Nephew overproof and Cointreau on hand. Was worried that the W&amp;N would kill the other ingredients given its monster funk factor, but I pressed on and did a full on 60ml shot. I like to shake mine with mint as well as a mint garnish to boost the aroma.

The batch of Orgeat I made had a huge flavour. I used a good amount of Cortas orange flower water in it (more than most recipes call for) and it stood up to the W&amp;N incredibly well. I have always preferred to up the Orgeat in place of simple syrup in Mai Tai's.

Here is the recipe I used:

\-60ml Wray and Nephew White overproof

\-25ml Homemade Orgeat

\-15ml Cointreau

\-30ml Fresh lime

\-Mint in shaker

I don't think this would work nearly as well with an off the shelf orgeat because W&amp;N is such a massive flavour. This turned out amazingly. Banana funk, sweet almondy creaminess, tart lime and then a background of orange flower.

The aloe hits first and is fruity and herbal, followed by the smoke and body of the mezcal.

Then, holy shit... it just all melded in a way that had me craving another sip, and then another... and then another cocktail.

Unlike fat-washing, [which is essentially an infusion technique](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2014/04/science-fat-washing-spirits-cocktails-how-fatwashing-works.html), milk-washing removes a number of polyphenols, like tannins. Basically, polyphenols bind with proteins in the milk, which is then removed, instead of staying in the liquid and later binding to proteins in our saliva. *Cook's Illustrated* has a great [piece](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/science/844-articles/story/the-key-to-crystal-clear-cocktails-milk-really) on this.

Anyway, the same process has a clarifying effect, which is why milk has sometimes traditionally been used for  fining wine. My guess is that the same process also affects mouthfeel‚Äîand not just by removing polyphenols.

I've never milk-washed something that's been fat-washed, but if milk-washing mainly removes polyphenols, then I suspect that it would only modify the effects of fat-washing to the extent that polyphenols  in the fat were extracted by the alcohol-water solution (i.e., the cocktail) in the first place. Olive oil, for instance, has some polyphenols in it. I'm not sure which end up in an olive oil-washed drink, but some might, and milk-washing might take them out. It'd be awesome to have a chart of these things that focuses on common fat-washing ingredients.",1586895333

293,cocktails,"We don't serve that exact spirit but we do serve several rums in that price range - Black Tot for example. The Tot has a small copper cup it's meant to be served in and the whole bottle has a wooden box in which it lives waaay at the top of our shelves. We don't so much convince people to buy as we get asked about our top shelf products. We sell it by the ounce, 70-80 dollars per ounce for some of our top shelf stuff. 

When people ask about specific spirits, we're happy to tell the stories about them as well as how they're made. We often have professionals in the distilling industry and process come in and tell us about the products and process. This gives us a lot to talk to people about.

As for selling a whole bottle, that doesn't really happen where I work. Were I to sell an ounce of the expensive stuff, I would recommend drinking it neat or in a daiquiri but would give the guest the drink however they asked for it to be served. If they're going to pay top dollar, they deserve the best service we can provide and their drink as they like it.

We need these containers to be sound for the long-term for the preservation of these fine liquors. As long as that is a focus, we're happy. Oh and tops that don't leak. Things get knocked over occasionally in our business. Something that doesn't leak is important.",1586860022

The original recipe called for a strawberry infused simple syrup and 2 dashes of angostura bitters.  I choose to use  a straight simple syrup and them muddle in 4 hulled and quartered strawberries.  I also chose to not use the bitters as I wanted the flavors of the strawberries to come through a little more.

For simple syrup, I prefer 1:1 as it's the baseline, and most recipes are calibrated for the dilution this adds; however, different sugars add different complexities to different drinks.

483,cocktails,Interesting! Especially since I always thought salt reduces bitterness,1586810773
484,cocktails,I also prefer a 2:1 for sure. I find myself reaching for Turbinado or Demerara most of the time when making cocktails because as you said they tend to be more complex and rich.

485,cocktails,"Honestly it‚Äôs one of my favorites right now. Basically it tastes like cocchi but with much more bitter back bone and a really nice floral/mineral wine character. In SF at least it‚Äôs cheaper than Cocchi too if you can find it.

I've never been a fan of salt rims, but the concept is that you get the salt, then the tart lime, then the heat of the tequila, then the flavors should mingle together.  It's supposed to be a flavor enhancer for the drink, but I fell it overpowers the drink.",1586810239
487,cocktails,"Turbinado vs Demerara vs White sugar is all about flavor differences for the most part. Dark sugar syrups are popular, for example, in tiki drinks as they add more complexity than white sugar and can stand up to the strong flavors. However, it would probably be too strong in something light like a french 75.

Gomme syrup provides more body to a drink but should never be your exclusive syrup in case you don't want your drink to become gummy.

I usually prefer a 2:1 syrup because you are adding less water to your drink for the same sweetness. Though, some people find that its to easy to over sweeten with a 2:1 syrup.

Note: if you look at a recipe calling for syrup, they usually mean 1:1, but always check if you can. Some recipes are based on 2:1 and switching this up can cause obvious issues.

Also, plenty of great bartenders just mix sugar and hot water by eye and don't worry about ratios as they simply taste the cocktail and then adjust the sweetness without concern for the overall ratio. Its not something I rec for people starting out, but just goes to show that using the ""right"" syrup is not the key to a great dirnk.",1586810117

20,cocktails,"It's not sickeningly sweet, but it is a sweet (and sour) drink. I think it's so much better if you pick a non sweet contreau otherwise it does edge into sickeningly sweet. And with a less sweet cocktail cherry, like the dark red rather than bright red ones. You can also slightly adjust the proportions. I like it a little heavy on the sour (and ideally use lime). It's a very easy to drink drink, it doesn't really taste alcoholic for those who don't like the alcohol bite. 

A good cousin is the white lady - equal parts gin, contreau and lemon juice. Because you drop the midori it's much more suited for people that don't like it so sweet or who like it more alcoholic.",1586806629

1 oz Gin

1/2 oz Peach Liquer of your choice

1 oz Cocchi Americano

3/4 oz lemon juice

This cocktail is very, very bright.  The peach and the Cocchi Americano really shine through the drink, and it's incredibly refreshing.  A very good summer/spring drink

Personally, l think C.A. is overpriced for the flavor profile, but people love to spend money on overpriced liquor. That being said, when I serve it I try to talk about how it is made, slow cooked and then aged in barrels for 8 months. I show them the bottle while I talk to try to help them understand WHY it is so pricey. Without directly saying that the custom bottle adds to the price instead of the quality inside, I do point out that all the bottles, decanters as they call them, are hand made. When ordering an expensive spirit I try to talk the customer into drinking it neat, but whatever the quest wants I provide. I always ring the bell on top of the bottle when I put it back on the shelf. Also I have a few questions. The only places that will serve you a full bottle are clubs ect. the same place you would buy a bottle of Absolute for 600$ so I dont think the customers at that establishment care about quality or taste, just the status symbol of having enough $ not to care. Creating a seal for these kind of items to keep the integrity of the spirit after opened is very important. Some brands use cork but cork can degrade over time, both from too dry to too wet.

1.5 oz lime juice

1 oz orange juice

1 oz apricot liqueur

1 oz cold brew coffee

0.5 oz cinnamon syrup

I'm going to partially ignore your search for toasty flavors and focus on a few cocktails that feature Scotch and have room to go peaty.

Old Fashioned. Think of it as a format, not a recipe and get a little weird. I recently used honey syrup instead of simple or a cube with Crude Orange and Fig bitters with Springbank 10. I have ginger syrup I might try with something like Highland Park 12 or even something like Ardbeg 10 and a grapefruit bitters, or perhaps grapefruit and Angostura. Crude sells a couple sample packs of bitters including a Coffee and Cocoa one that is an interesting twist of a rye OF.

Penicillin. I made one last week with Highland Park Magnus mixed with a float of Talisker 10.

Endgame. Greg from How to Drink did a variation on the Last Word (traditionally equal parts gin, lime, Luxardo maraschino, and Chartreuse) with lemon and peated Scotch subbed in for lime and gin.

Fresh bitter flavors are often added by Campari or Aperol. If you see a recipe with either, you might be heading the right direction. Paper Plane and Negroni are both common examples.",1586800459

* 4ml simple syrup

60,cocktails,"Cheti is unequivocally my pick for greatest living bartender, though I've never met him. I did, however, start this quarantine by reading both of his cocktail books and they may offer some insight into this class... or they may not.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I really admire about him is that if you went to his old bar Dandelyan, you would get cocktails with things like mummified lime and pine &amp; palm embalming cordial. His books are very different though. The first one would be the perfect cocktail book for my mother. It's for an audience that likes the idea of drinking cocktails but doesn't want to get overly fussy about it. It makes heavy use of soda water both to obviate shaking and increase potability. The flavor combinations are good, reasonably interesting, and easy to emulate. 

&amp;#x200B;

His second book gets a little more technical -- it's loosely themed around dinner parties so there's an expectation that the reader is willing to do some extra prep to dazzle their guests (e.g. make an oleo saccharum, make some simple infusions, dry shake a cocktail) and the flavors are a little more adventurous but it's still not exactly a repository of his vast knowledge or a guide to making his more ambitious recipes at home.

So this drink is a classic blended ice pop in Ireland called the loop the loop, a lemon and lime flavoured rice pop. So I bought 4 loop the loops blended them up (removing the chocolate casing at the top for anyone in Ireland). Added sparkling water to get the liquid icy texture. Spooned it in to a shaker added shot and a half of tanqueray gin, and poured over a small bit of crushed ice. Lemon and lime icy gin, in a texture like a daiquiri",1586789932

It was a double chocolate stout with a couple liquors including Bulleit bourbon (also for the pun) poured into the mug from the shot glass.  It sounded incredible.

And that is a good point, My favourite Islay for sipping is probably Ardbeg, but Laphroaig is probably better for approachable smoke.

Reading these recipes, even if one doesn't have the ingredients, is still great inspiration. I'm sorry to see nothing but complaints about complexity in response. These are thoughtful well built cocktails that do not use obscure ingredients just for the sake of seeming erudite. I applaud this effort and your drinks. 

One thing I have taken away already is the dry shake after straining technique used in the Bee's Knee's riff. This technique seems like a really good idea and I'm going to try it with my next cocktail using egg. 

I also really enjoyed the section on non-alcoholic drinks. I make non-alcoholic drinks often for myself and enjoy trying to replicate the potent flavor of a cocktail with out spirits or just creating something light and refreshing to enjoy. The addition of syrups was also really inspiring.

209,cocktails,"Haha, you just work at a bar?  Even people with really deep bottle collections can‚Äôt make the majority of that stuff.  

And yeah, you can make substitutions, but oftentimes the magic of a given cocktail is that obscure liqueur, tonic, or infusion you‚Äôre using.  Hell, even going from one brand of Jamaican rum to another makes a very different Mai Tai.

That said, I‚Äôm gonna pick a couple tough ones and give it a try.  Thanks for sharing!",1586763094
210,cocktails,"I'd say it's very similar to Campari but a little less bitter and more orange, yes. It still has something of a complex herbal flavor though. 

It's a bit more user friendly as a bitter ap√©ritif on its own so it's nice on the rocks with a twist and maybe a splash of soda water. 

But I prefer Campari as a cocktail ingredient though. Aperol just doesn't mix up in a Negroni or Boulevardier as well as Campari does.",1586761910
211,cocktails,"I'm starting out too but key things I've learned so far:

Dave Arnold's Fundamental Law of Cocktails: ‚ÄúThere is no chilling without dilution, and there is no dilution without chilling.‚Äù

Which means cocktails only get cold when ice melts into water. You trade chilling power for dilution. You can't have one without the other. It's hard to understand at first but just keep that in mind for the future.

Drinks need dilution for balance. Dilution is not making drinks worse. Drink recipes aka drink specs are written with dilution in mind. 

Perception of sweetness changes with temperature. Different sweeteners behave differently, eg sucrose sweetness dulls with cold. Part of why chilling cocktails is important, to keep drinks in balance. Also part of why it's important to drink cocktails before they warm up. 

Bitterness is there to add depth and character to drinks, play off other flavors and visa versa.

Sense of smell informs what you taste. Eg I don't think negronis are worth drinking without a citrus peel expressed over it to hit you in the nose

All cocktails generally are variations based off of 6 root cocktails. See the book Cocktail Codex. 

Keep vermouth in the fridge. It goes off after 1-2 months after opening. Buy smaller bottles so you have less to finish. 

This video is the best single video crash course on cocktails I've seen: 

https://youtu.be/h_LPWSukZDE

I'm a gear nerd and the best home bar tools for the money I've tried is Top Shelf (the also go by the brand A Bar Above). Cocktail Kingdom is merely average; I've been disappointed with a lot of their build quality and have returned half of the stuff I've bought from them. Definitely not worth a premium.

$73 Top Shelf bar kit: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077SSP7T3/

This kit requires a mixing glass. Get this one or a different one with a style you like as long as it has a tiny spout. Some spouts are too big to get a tight strain using a Hawthorne strainer (but you can default to a Julep strainer): https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XCTFPL1/

I much prefer the OXO angled jigger than standard conical jiggers so get that too: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077SSP7T3/

That's all I got for now. Good luck.",1586761507
212,cocktails,"I think that depends on what you enjoy and what your budget/per-item allotment is. \*Disclaimer; Mileage may vary as taste is subjective\*

I am a whisk(e)y nerd so thats what I can make recommendations on.  
in the &lt;$30 each range I recommend Buffalo Trace, Dewar's White Label, Tullamore DEW, and Rittenhouse Bonded Rye  
in the &lt;$50 each range I like Yellowstone Select or Eagle Rare, Shackleton Blended Malt, Writer's Tears, and Catoctin Creek Roundstone Rye (though splurging a bit on the Distiller's edition is definitely worth it)

If you are on a tighter budget I recommend Evan Williams White Label/Bottled in bond ($15), Teacher's Highland Cream ($20), Paddy's Old Irish Whiskey ($20), and Jim Beam Rye ($24, but there aren't many more budget friendly ryes I would feel comfortable suggesting)",1586760644

214,cocktails,"Another recipe from my SO fiddling around during quarantine. This one is called the Butterfly Sour and it is a twist on a Boston Sour.

 

### Ingredients

* 50 ml Bourbon I used Buffalo Trace
* 25 ml Lemon Juice freshly squeezed
* 35 ml Creme de Butterfly homemade (since I don't think it's sold in stores)
* 1 small Egg White

### Instructions

* In a cocktail shaker add the bourbon, lemon juice, and creme de butterfly and give a shake for a few seconds.
* Open the shaker, add 3 ice cubes and the egg white. Shake very hard for 30 seconds.
* Strain into a chilled Nick and Nora or a coupe glass and let rest for 5 minutes. Garnish with a few dried butterfly pea flowers.

As the authors put it, ""This book aims to teach both novice and accomplished drink makers how to master half a dozen iconic cocktails‚Äîand invent new ones‚Äîusing an approach that has become integral to our bar programs: root cocktails. The book is organized into six chapters, each using a classic, or root, cocktail to teach lessons you can apply to all cocktails."" They add that, ""Our six root cocktails are less a historical lineage than an approach to understanding the fundamentals. By studying each of these six drinks, you will learn the mechanics of a particular family of cocktails as well as important lessons in technique and ingredients that will elevate your overall cocktail game.""

389,cocktails,"Reductive? I'd argue that saying ""the rum has no rules cliche is reductive"" is more reductive than the cliche itself. And I didn't say ""rum has no rules,"" I said ""rum is not well regulated""... which is 100% true. Or maybe instead of saying not ""well"" regulated I should've said it's not ""tightly"" regulated. Anyway...

Some rum producing countries impose stricter regulations on themselves, but it's not mandatory and typically the exception not the rule. Look at all the flavored rums that have god-knows-what added to them... that simply cannot exist with other categories of spirit. 

The problem for rum is that it has no equivalent appellation to that of Bourbon or Scotch or Cognac or Champagne that creates a contract of quality between producer and buyer. Rum is a free for all.

I took a bottle of vodka and used half for fat washing with cacao butter and did a speed infusion in my ISI siphon with cacao nibs. Both were good on their own and come together beautifully.

Obviously the siphon is a barrier to entry. Fat washing with cacao butter is easy enough though, and lends a really nice flavor.

I've never tried using chocolate like you did, so I can't comment on that.

One thing I have done is to use creme de cacao in place of the simple syrup and chocolate bitters instead of ango to make myself chocolate old fashioneds. I think it turns out great. Tempus Fugit makes a creme de cacao that is just heavenly. If you're a fan of chocolate like I am, then it's well worth the price.",1586724165

I decided to do an old fashioned as a way to benchmark this infusion. Basic recipe, whiskey, 1tsp simple syrup and few dashes of Angostura bitters.

I think it turned out ok but not more than this. There's some chocolaty flavour but not too much. Still, I'm happy that I proved to myself that this is technically possible.

I have a few theories as to why that‚Äôs the case, but I‚Äôll spare you for now.",1586709828
60,cocktails,"&gt; Does sherry go bad after awhile like vermouth does?

Not OP, but I‚Äôm a bartender and sherry fanatic, so I feel qualified to answer.

The short version is: Yes. It‚Äôs wine; it will go bad after it‚Äôs been opened.

The longer version is: Yes, but how long you have before a sherry goes bad depends on the type of sherry you‚Äôre dealing with.

‚ÄúSherry‚Äù isn‚Äôt a single style of wine; it‚Äôs a broad spectrum of different products made in the one delimited region of Spain, Jerez. (Actually, some of the grapes for sherry can be and are grown outside of the Jerez region‚Äîit‚Äôs complex‚Äîbut all the wines are *made* in the region.) The two big factors that will determine how well a sherry fares after you open it are 1) how much oxygen it sees during ageing and 2) how much sugar is in the wine.

The oxygen matters because oxygen is usually what makes normal table wines degrade after opening. The styles of sherry that have been aged ‚Äúbiologically‚Äù‚Äîthat is, under a layer of what the locals call *flor*, which is a thick raft of different yeasts‚Äîhave been protected from oxygenation by that layer of yeast. These wines‚Äîlabelled fino or manzanilla‚Äîwill go bad relatively quickly. They‚Äôre fortified, so they won‚Äôt turn as quickly as a table wine, but I wouldn‚Äôt keep an open bottle in the fridge for more than a week. (No open bottle of sherry ever lasts that long in my house anyway!) The styles of sherry that have seen more oxygen as they age will last longer: so amontillados last a bit longer, palo cortados a bit longer still, and olorosos even longer. If in doubt, colour is a good guide: darker/browner sherries have seen more oxygen than lighter/more golden sherries.

Sugar also helps slow down spoilage, which is why sweet vermouth lasts longer than dry vermouth. The sweeter the sherry, the longer it is likely to last: cream sherry lasts longer than (dry) oloroso, moscatel lasts longer than cream, and pedro ximenez lasts longest of all, because it‚Äôs basically as sweet as simple syrup. The good news is that sweetness and oxidation are usually correlated in sherry (with only a small number of exceptions), so in general the sweeter the sherry the more oxygen it‚Äôs seen. Even though PX sherry comes out of the bottle as black as cola, it‚Äôs actually made from a white grape; all of its colour comes from oxidation.

Some other things to note: some finos and manzanillas are deliberately aged a bit longer than others, and see a touch of oxygen; these will tend to hold up better than their younger siblings. Also, if a sherry is labelled ‚Äúen rama‚Äù it will be a bit less fragile, too. Finally, since all sherry exists on a spectrum of oxygenation, where you draw the line between ‚Äúokay‚Äù and ‚Äúspoiled‚Äù is subjective; some people only drink manzanillas that have been very freshly bottled and finish a bottle in a sitting (which is why manzanillas come in a smaller 375 mL bottle), while others are happy for them to get a bit funkier as they get exposed to oxygen in the fridge.",1586709407

* 20oz barcardi white
* 16oz pineapple juice (with 8g citric and 5g malic acid powders)
* 10oz coconut milk
* 6oz simple
* 12oz whole milk

Combine everything but the milk first. I noticed some separation after adding the coconut milk so I mixed it with a whisk before adding the whole milk. Milk washing was slower than usual because the coconut milk contributed to the density of curds in the pre-filtering mixture.

It is a little bit on the sweeter side, although i would call it a balanced drink. My Tepache is not very sweet. If your tepache is sweeter i would recomend to reduce the syrups.

I just recently perfected a reproduction of Pacific Cocktail Haven's Sweating in a Sun Dress (aged rum, amburana cachaca, mango, almond milk, Amaro CioCiaro, citrus). Apparently, Amaro CioCiaro is a recommended substitute for Amer Picon?

The concept of substitutions is definitely in my mind. I need to spend some time thinking about the best way to do it but it's certainly handy for close matches!

1. if I received a drink of this quality in a good bar, I'd be thrilled
2. it's perfected to my palate
3. I've tasted it on two separate occasions and it was great both times

and with the expectation that, if someone likes all the ingredients in a recipe, they'll love this as well. It's not a hard requirement since it's a little fuzzy but I've definitely passed on recipes I expected to love (based on their ingredients) but which just didn't work.

The rules above also mean I don't necessarily show a ""definitive, original"" recipe by default. There are very few I haven't tweaked at least a little. But I include historic recipes in the Android version (will be exposed in a future iOS version) so you can go back to the original recipe I started with.

So, given a few versions of a drink with the same name, I go with the one I like the best. I can't guarantee it's perfect for everyone's tastes since that's impossible but the app should be able to get anyone there within a few iterations, hopefully. And, they can be done over any time span, so you can take your time.

128,cocktails,"Hey foggy4321! 
When it comes to Pisco, the first thing to consider it's what country it comes from, either Peru or Chile. Both countries have different regulations in regards to its production so the bottles taste quite differently and therefore, they work in different styles of cocktails.
Barsol is a Peruvian brand, and as such, it works incredibly well in fresh/refreshing cocktails. Try the following:
- Chilcano: Classic recipe, served as a highball. Pisco, lime, bit of sugar, ginger ale and bitters. 
- Pisco, green apple, lime and ginger
- Pisco, passionfruit and a bit of strawberry (frozen)
- Also try other variations of Pisco sour, adding basil, ginger or some type of berries, they are always amazing!

Don't forget to also taste Chilean Pisco! I would recommend you buy an aged version, such as Mistral Noble, so you can taste the difference ;)",1586606330
129,cocktails,"Looks beautiful!  Congrats.  I always think of an Old Fashioned like a steak; minimal ingredients, but the finesse of the cook makes or breaks it.

I personally prefer rye instead of bourbon in mine.  I find that the spicy character balances out the sweet a little bit.  I forgo the dash of soda as well as I sip mine slowly and that combined with the melting ice just makes it too watery for me.

Lastly, if you really want to go down the rabbit hole, I make a batch of rich demerara gum syrup and keep that on hand for these.  The gum really improves the mouthfeel IMO and makes it a truly special drink.

From one of my books, recipe follows:

300g demerara sugar

18g gum arabic

150g water

Blend sugar and gum arabic together in blender.  Slowly add water and continue to blend until ingredients are dissolved, about 2 minutes.  Pour into plastic bag, remove air and seal, place in immersion circulator (sous vide) at 145F.  Cook for two hours.  Then move to ice bath, cool, bottle, store in fridge.

I no longer have a sous vide, so I just put it in 150F water and top off with boiling water every 30 min or so to maintain heat.  It sounds like a lot but it's really not bad, and the syrup can be substituted into any cocktail that calls for simple syrup (just remember to halve the amount).

Gum arabic can be found online.  I buy mine from Modernist Pantry, but I'm sure you can find it other places as well if needed.

Lastly, I usually halve this recipe, as it makes quite a bit of syrup.

Infusing it into the vodka should get you the best flavour. just one vanilla pod in a bottle and test and gentle shake daily. perhaps also add a clove and a peel of orange (one strip, not a whole orange - just make sure you have no pith). Good news is there is not really that much difference between cheaper vodkas and top shelf vodkas when you're infusing, so if you need to save a few bucks to be able to afford the vanilla pod then you can do it there. 

Also look at reducing (or cutting out completely) the simple syrup. You should have more than enough from the other ingredients

Very straightforward Mint Julep in my opinion. People‚Äôs thresholds for sweetness differ, so feel free to do less or more depending on your taste, and also with the amount of alcohol. This is such a beautiful simple drink that you can build to your own liking. Here‚Äôs what I did today:

2 oz. Bourbon

.5 oz. simple syrup

8 mint leaves lightly pressed (not obliterated) with the simple syrup before adding bourbon.



Add Bourbon. Once it‚Äôs built, add about 1/2 the tin of your crushed ice, and slowly stir to start the dilution and chilling process for the tin.

Continue to add amounts of crushed ice while incorporating it together until tin is full, then grab remaining shaved ice and build a sno cone. Grab several mint sprigs, spank em, and assemble where you intend on putting your straw. You want those mint oils hitting your nose with each sip.

So, since I found some blackcurrant leaf cordial from a few years ago in the freezer while being lazy at home, I figured I'd make a cocktail with the stuff and name it for another lazy fellow. 

Blackcurrant leaf is reminiscent of elderflower, but more towards the herbal than floral, so I took a recipe with eldeflower liqueur, simplified it (can't have the lazy man's cocktail be complicated), and replaced the elderflower with blackcurrant leaf. 

The result is pretty good, I'd have to say, but hard to describe what it tastes like in terms of other things. It's rather unique.

For a citrus based cocktail 2 parts booze, 1 part sweetener (1-1 simple) 1 part sour (lemon or lime)

This is a bit sweet for some but in general works for a balanced drink. If your sweetener has alcohol or is less sweet than simple then adjust. You could also think of a points scale.

16 parts alchohol (80 proof) 8 parts sweet 8 parts sour and make sure your drink adds up.

For Spirit forward is 4 parts booze 1 part sweet plus bitter

Classic old fashioned 2 oz booze 1/2 oz simple, Ango

Manhattan 3 oz whiskey 1 oz sweet vermouth + bitters (Vermouth has alcohol and is less sweet than pure syrup so up the amount)

This is a good starting point - adjust for your taste, of course.",1586543163
452,cocktails,Rittenhouse Rye is around $20 and makes a mean Manhattan.,1586543138
453,cocktails,It really matters what vermouth you are putting in for any of the Campari cocktails. For an Americano I like Cocchi Vermouth di Torino which you can find in half bottles. It has a good bit of vanilla sweetness which stands up to the Campari bitter making for a sweet and slightly bitter creamy soda. For a Negroni I prefer Punt E Mes which is a bit more bitter and complex. Carpano Antica is thick with deep vanilla and chocolate notes perfect for a Manhattan or other whiskey based cocktails,1586543021

468,cocktails,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôm Travis and I‚Äôve built a cocktail app over the last 6 years in my spare time!

[I posted last year about my Android beta](https://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/aok17c/hi_rcocktails_ive_spent_4_years_building_a/) and got great feedback from everyone. A common response was ‚Äúlooks great - please let me know when it‚Äôs available for iPhones‚Äù. The iPhone beta is now ready :)

I‚Äôm really excited because I think DoubleStrain will help you make the best cocktails you‚Äôve ever made whether you‚Äôre just getting into cocktails or you‚Äôre a seasoned pro. My app helps you explore a wide variety of cocktail ingredients and how they work together. And even if you know exactly what you want to do, it‚Äôs a great way to track your recipes and perfect them at your own pace.

Key features:

* **Instant, smart feedback based on your ratings**. You can rate drinks based on how sweet, sour, strong, etc. they are. The app understands how cocktails and their ingredients work so it can give you [specific suggestions](http://doublestrain.com/raw-screenshots/0p7mo7kijd1c6exi11wu6eox9x2qyb) you can apply with a tap. Is your Margarita not sweet enough? It will suggest you increase the simple syrup, triple sec or add a new sweet ingredient that complements the other ingredients.
* **Simplify your recipes**. If you‚Äôre creating something original but it‚Äôs just too ‚Äúmuddy‚Äù, the app will figure out the best ingredient to cut to make the recipe more focused and you can appreciate every flavor that goes into it.
* **A heavily-curated list of craft cocktail recipes**. I‚Äôve combed through thousands, tasted hundreds, and fine-tuned the small portion of those [recipes I consider rock-solid](http://doublestrain.com/raw-screenshots/wdgcwpdoz6ompso51nj7n96x36e2gt). I even included a few [originals](https://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/9tnzw3/occams_razor/) I‚Äôm really proud of!
* **All suggestions are based on your tastes**. Even amazing recipes can‚Äôt be perfect for everyone. If a drink needs a slight adjustment, rate and improve it with a few taps. The next time you make it (whether it‚Äôs in 10 minutes or 10 months), the app will remember in case you don‚Äôt!
* **Automatic recipe art**. Every recipe (even your original creations) gets beautiful artwork based directly on the ingredients, garnish, and glass you choose. Even the color of the drink is automatic. [Try adding or removing Campari and see the dramatic red shift](http://doublestrain.com/raw-screenshots/qxc08ixaoakbhqvclnvnu3t9471p8l).

I‚Äôm currently doing a beta for iPhones and I‚Äôd love you to try it for free right now: install the TestFlight app then [visit this link on your iPhone](https://testflight.apple.com/join/360CnKp3).

[The Android version is available on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.doublestrain).

To get updates about the app, please [sign up for our mailing list (see the green box on our website)](http://doublestrain.com/). It‚Äôs very low-traffic.

I‚Äôd be thrilled to see what all of you think of [DoubleStrain](http://doublestrain.com/) and answer any questions.

I‚Äôll start with a question for all of you: what‚Äôs your biggest challenge to making great cocktails? Difficulty selecting ingredients to pair together? Availability of specific ingredients? Finding high-quality recipes?

It *could* be decreased sugar content but there‚Äôs no information on the bottle. Maybe a redditor with a meter can compare the brix but I don‚Äôt have one at home.

In this cocktail it works much better. I find it needs less dilution than when made with the OG, which I found rather sweet, and I may even up the cynar 70 to 1oz in this recipe. I originally moved it to 2:1:1 (actually 1.5:.75:.75) from 1:1:1 because it was way too sweet.",1586539336

Happy National G&amp;T Day!

Haven't been feeling inspired to create the last few days but had to whip something up to celebrate, and like magic, as soon as I did the sun broke through the clouds. Some days you just have to fake it until it all comes together. 

Choosing a gin for this one proved to be the most important decision made, I think the salinity of The Botanist Gin really helps to cut through the sweetness of the syrups used while still highlighting the pear flavours.

**Ritz**

Recipe By: [Dale DeGroff, Ritz New York](https://www.diffordsguide.com/cocktails/recipe/1677/ritz-cocktail)

*Summary:* 

The Ritz is a cocktail that is a riff on the French 75. It was created by Dale DeGroff and named after the Ritz New York hotel. 

Like the original French 75, the spirit is cognac. Spirit swap to gin and you have a **Ritz London**.

Start with a French 75, and replace the simple syrup with triple sec and maraschino

*Ingredients:*

* 1 ounce cognac
* 1/2 ounce Cointreau
* 1/4 ounce maraschino liqueur
* 1/4 ounce lemon juice

78,cocktails,"Not OP but I've made cocktails with both.

Including the yolk adds a kind of richness &amp; a much more noticeable smooth/Creamy texture to the overall drink. It is sweet and tends to be fairly dense. The flavor it adds is reasonably neutral (though, of course, ""eggy"") but I do think you'd still want to mainly use it in a recipe that is a bit bolder. I would not recommend it ""anywhere a white is appropriate"" because it will muddy the flavor, so you'd want to know what you're getting. 

The best way to learn, of course, is just to try several! The most classic using a full egg, and thus best to become acquainted, is the flip:

* 2 oz spirit (try sherry or cognac/brandy to start)
* 1/2 oz demerara syrup/sugar syrup
* 1 whole egg

Dry shake, then shake over ice. Double strain.

To isolate just the yolk's contribution, also try the classic golden fizz:

* 1.5 oz gin

* yolk of one egg

* 1/2 oz lemon or lime juice

* 1/2 Tablespoon sugar

* soda to top

Shake with ice, strain neat into fizz glass. Top with soda. (If you don't have a fizz glass, use a highball but don't fill it all the way. The fizz is smaller &amp; doesn't use ice, so you don't want to over-water it down with the soda.)",1586529471

3 part strong

1 part lime juice (be careful if yours is concentrated)

1 part mango rum 1 part passionfruit 1 part overproof
2 parts pineapple juice 2 parts soda",1586528606

I infused a mild Gin (Strombery I think) with celery and mixed 1.5 oz Celery infused Gin with about 4 ounces of ""Green mix""

To make the green mix:

8 oz. Pineapple Juice

1.25 oz lime juice

1.25 oz Demerrara Syrup (Or whatever you fancy)

8 Mint leaves

Sprigs of Cilantro about equal volume to mint

2 slices of fresh Jalapeno

Salt and Pepper

Pulse blend until greens are very fine. I let this settle a while then strained because I didn't want a cloudy frothy finish. Lime juice and Salt/Pepper rim. Makes enough for two drinks. It starts out yellow but gradually gets greener as it sits.

If I made it again I would not use the celery infused Gin. I felt it confused the drink and didn't mesh with the other flavors. My wife loved it.  I would also up the gin in the ratio because I like to taste booze in my drinks, but again my wife loved it the way it was. I think it would work really well with a dry gin. 

I liked these a lot and enjoyed something a bit different. Its worth the effort. They are green, in flavor, but with the fruitiness of pineapple. The only problem for me was the celery clashed with these other green flavors. The Jalapeno and black pepper really made this drink for me.

As per rule number one of this subreddit, the following is my personal method for construction a Gin &amp; Tonic:

First, chill a Collins glass in the freezer. Make sure your tonic water has been refrigerated as well. And don't forget to have enough ice, either.

Next, cut a lime in half, then in half again. This quarter of a lime is muddled in the base of the chilled Collins glass to release as much juice from the flesh and oils from the skin as possible.

Then, measure out two ounces of gin of your choice. On National Gin &amp; Tonic Day, I use the best I've got on hand. Pour the gin into the glass and stir it together with the lime juice.

Finally, add three perfect one inch ice cubes into the glass, crack open your tonic water, and pour into the glass until it's full. Give the whole thing a half-turn around with your barspoon (or the knife you used to slice the lime) and you're ready to enjoy.

Of course, enjoy your Gin &amp; Tonic your way on this special day. Cheers!",1586470729

Cocktail week instructor said you can add the citric acid a tiny bit at a time to truly get the minimum amount necessary for curdling and then move the curdles around more and for longer to minimize the amount needed for the actual washing if that's your goal.  So maybe minimize milk/acid for tea syrup but when I like the idea of orange cream in a Curacao not so much? I'm also playing with tea heavy milk punches with sodium alginate spherified liqueurs to make an alcoholic bubble tea that isn't just adding liquor to Technicolor tea powder, in which case I also don't want to go minimal on milk.

Add 1 oz of water (which is less dilution than if stirred) and we get the ABV down to 20%, which freezes at approximate 10F (-12C).  If you're using a top or bottom-mounted freezer, start by setting it as low as it will go.

To other people it just denotes a somewhat stiffer drink without ice served in a stemmed, usually V-shaped glass, but in a more convenient term, and more people (seemingly) care about that convenience of terminology than what you care about. 

Not to mention the title Pornstar Martini and Martini are obviously different, with one having a descriptor next to it, plus menus will put down ingredients so that no one is confused about it having gin and/or vermouth. Even more reasons most drinker have no issue with it.

* 5 tsp. (7.5 grams) table salt

* 1 part Gin (Melis recommends Beefeater London Dry, but Bombay Dry Gin works, too)
* 1 part Sweet Vermouth (Melis used Martini &amp; Rossi, but any high-quality Red/Sweet Vermouth that you love works, too. I used Cocchi)
* 1 part Campari
* 1 part Saline Water
* Orange (for garnish)
* Large ice cube

Pour the first three ingredients into a large pitcher or shaker and stir (this is NOT a shaken cocktail) for 25 seconds.

Pour in the Saline Water and stir for another 15 seconds. 

Grab out a pre-chilled glass with a large cube of ice inside, and then pour in the cocktail.

Add in a wedge of orange for garnish!

**Batch Drink**

Take the above ingredients, increase them as you see fit, and prepare them as per the directions above.

Place those parts in a bottle then place them in your freezer. You can now drink this mix directly from the bottle (no extra dilution needed), and pour them directly into a chilled glass with an orange wedge.

57,cocktails,"Haha yes! Very true, basically you shake the shit out of it. I'm essentially following the recipe from Cocktail Codex but with a few tweaks. Dry shake for about 30 seconds, then hard shake with a couple large cubes for around 5 minutes. I double strained and then let the drink sit in the freezer for around 10 minutes. I watched a bartender in New Orleans make the drink this way and it was amazing. Take the drink out of the freezer, then dip a barspoon in the drink to create a little hole to allow the seltzer to pass through the foam. Slowly pour the seltzer on the barspoon and let it glide down the center of the drink, lifting the puck of foam higher above the rim of the glass.

1 dash Bitter Truth Creole Bitters (I recall Bittermen's Mole bitters being nice as well)

I preferred to just batch it all up and stir it, but that will leave a bit of a texture to it that you may not be looking for the first time out. Shaking it is totally fine.

 Scalable to milk punch, I'm not sure I used a different recipe for milk punch and lemon juice is part of my desired flavor profile/balance.

Curds are what do the actual clarifying so I generally gently mix it every so often during the hour it's sitting.  The pouring the solution back over the curds in a cheese cloth I picked up from a pdx cocktail week class.

Pectinex is not necessary if you don't have a centrifuge, it just allows the solids to stick together against the outer walls so they don't fall back into the clarified product.  I have not made the milk washed spirit with out the centrifuge yet but I did do old school version of milk punch first without it just to prove to myself I could and believe that any reasonable amount in one serving would be considered clear to the naked eye.  It wasn't until I had 12 oz in a bottle particles were bugging me.  That being said I fully believe you could do the single spirit wash with out the centrifuge

How do you think the result varied using the pectinex instead of without?

Regarding making the strong tea syrups and liqueurs, you mean because the milk/curdling is essentially stripping out all the tannins you can push flavors further while removing what would otherwise be unusable result?

0.25 oz. Clarified lime juice
Creme Yvette

214,cocktails,"Previously I'd only done it in milk punches but almost the exact same process and no not hard at all.  An easy way is a scaled down version of... Combine 1 liter spirit with 250 ml whole milk and let sit for five min.  Add 15 grams citric acid solution (4:1 water:citric acid powder but you can also just add lemon juice until curdles form) and stir and let sit for an hour (original recipe says 12 hours redfrigerated but 1 still works.) Strain over cheese cloth, keep curds, strain again over curds, fine strain with coffee filter.

Mine was this but instead of all the filtering I weighed out 0.2% of the combined weight of the spirit/milk and stirred that into my curdles solution, let it sit for 15 min, and spun it in a centrifuge for 20 minutes.  The difference between centrifuge and straining for clarity isn't that much but the yield is better and it's less work.

276,cocktails,"What are you on about? Sugar is sugar. If a liqueur has sugar in it, you have to factor that in to how much sugar is in the drink in total. Some liqueurs are sweeter than others, so you need to adjust accordingly. Also, the 2: 3/4: 3/4 format is not a hard and fast rule. In fact, most classic cocktail books call for a 2:1:.5 ratio for a sour. The equal parts sour/sweet seems to be a more modern American convention that appeals to the sweeter American palate. 

Also, sugar‚Äôs role in a drink is usually to balance either booze, bitterness, or acid (or any combination of the above). Balancing sugar with water is only a factor if you‚Äôre making a longer drink e.g. something topped with soda. In OP‚Äôs drink, there is no added water, so the sugar is mostly there to balance the acid. 

In OP‚Äôs drink, the Pommeau de Normandie is adding both booze and sweetness to the drink, in the same way that Cointreau does in a margarita. But it‚Äôs not quite sweet enough to completely balance the drink, hence the extra 1/4oz of simple. Looking at the specs, and knowing these ingredients well, I would say that this drink would be perfectly balanced. I‚Äôm definitely gonna try this whenever my bar reopens.",1586379062

You say always start 2 spirit / .75  citrus/ .75 sugar  right? Cool. I agree with that. That's my starting point for almost any sour as well. We're starting from the same place.

Here's the thing though ... His construction is:

1.5 spirit / .75 citrus / .75 sugar (.5 pommeau + .25 simple)

That's a **higher** sugar : citrus : spirit ratio than your own professed starting recipe. So if anything, on paper, it's got *too much* sugar based on the exact logic you proposed yourself. So you're kinda arguing against yourself my dude.

Although White Negroni was originally made with Gin, Lillet Blanc &amp; Suze, you may often easily encounter White Negronis with Dolin Blanc, Cocchi Americano, Kina L'A√©ro d'Or, Saler's &amp; Luxardo Bitter Bianco as their components.

While my preferred Negroni ratio's either 1.5/0.75/0.75 or 1/0.75/0.75 due to its massive sweetness, I find White Negroni to be not as off-balanced even with 1:1:1 ratio; perhaps you could use that to your advantage.

-----------------------------

**Suggested Ratio:**

* *1oz Gin*
* *0.75oz Blanc Vermouth | 0.25oz Italicus*
* *0.75oz Luxardo Bitter Bianco | 0.25oz Saler's*
* *1-2 dashes each of Grapefruit Bitters &amp; Pine Tincture*

You may raise the Gin ratio up to 1.5oz if you want its botanical notes to be crisper and more apparent.

I suggest playing around with the ratios of bitter components (Bitter Bianco &amp; Saler's) since I have no idea whether Clover Club leans more toward Gentian bitterness or not.

Find **your** ratio. A truly well mixed Martini will have a ""bright"" taste.

* If there's too much gin (in relation to vermouth and water), the drink will taste a bit ""thin"".
* If there's too much vermouth, it will taste ""soggy"".
* If it has been stirred too long, and has too much water, it will taste ""flat"".

For me, it's 3:1 with 1 dash of orange bitters. But that is certainly a function of the gin and the vermouth. I'm using Tanqueray N^(o.)Ten and Vya Extra Dry.

438,cocktails,"When I helped open a gin bar in town a few years ago, one of the servers' expressed disgust of vermouth. I countered by making a series from all gin to equal parts gin and dry vermouth (all with orange bitters and a lemon twist) at half ounce increments in a 3 oz build. Most everyone either favored the 2:1 or the 1:1 ratios. But it's a great experiment to do.

It's just like my asking a great bartender in town circa 2007 what the difference between a shaken and stirred Martini was, and he made me one of each to see and taste. From it's cloudiness, different wash line (final volume), and change in flavor from the integrated gas.",1586353487

458,cocktails,"&gt; Bitters (especially Angostura) are not part of a traditional gin Martini.

Depends how far back you‚Äôre looking. The very earliest recipes for the ‚ÄúMartini cocktail‚Äù from the 1880s (like Harry Johnson‚Äôs) use old tom gin, sweet vermouth, orange cura√ßao, gomme, and a few dashes of bitters. Their descendent, the Marguerite cocktail, which is one of the earliest drinks to look like a contemporary gin martini, calls for dry gin, dry vermouth, and dashes of orange bitters.

Anyway, to answer OP‚Äôs question: if you‚Äôre making a dry gin martini, orange bitters are nice, but by no means necessary. Better to skip the bitters altogether if you only have access to Angostura or other varieties of aromatic bitters.",1586342177

Coconut and coffee was a combo I'm well acquainted with from my Starbucks days, and the coffee Negroni I had last week showed me how well coffee and Campari goes together. Just a matter of putting it all together with a less than subtle nod to your post.

If I were to do it again, I might up the Campari to a full oz, just to balance the bitterness a bit.

- 1/4 oz (7ml) of maple suryp
- 2 dashes of angostura bitters
- ~2 oz (60ml) of bacon-washed bourbon
- Orange peel for garnish

Add everything but the orange peel to a glass, add in ice and stir to dilute, express an orange peel over it and drop in.


For Bacon-washed Bourbon (makes about 4-4.5 oz):
- ~5 oz (150 ml) of Woodford Reserve (the leftovers from a large batch of mint juleps
- 70 grams of bacon

Fry up bacon until all fat has melted (optional: enjoy as part of a complete breakfast). Add to bottle of bourbon (if making larger batches you want something with a larger opening, like a glass jar, as the fat will form a solid membrane, with smaller quantities the bottle will do fine)

Let stand for 4-5 hours with regular agitation to let the bourbon absorb the flavor, then place in freezer overnight to fully solidify all fat.

Strain into another bottle through a wetted coffeefilter, squeeze out moisture from the fat curdles, some volume will be lost in the process, sadly.



Notes from the creator: I would reccomend using a cheaper bourbon, the result from the Woodford were lovely, but i felt some complexity was lost.

This drink had a very long evolution, with orange and bacon on the nose, the instantly the sweetness of the maple suryp followed by the remaining notes of the woodford, then angostura and finally the round, smokey baconnotes, all melding wonderfully together; probably one of the best drink I've made, rivalled only by the How To Drink-Inspired Gin Whisper!",1586296977

* 1oz Cynar
* 1/4oz St Germain

I‚Äôve tried the recipe you listed, but it was way too sweet for my taste and the predominant tastes were elderflower and the smith &amp; cross, with only a little bit of cynar aroma.

382,cocktails,Confined without maraschino,1586248594
383,cocktails,"Sorry if it feels like I'm saying the same thing over and over, but here's how you can improve your tray.

1. Find a watertight container that fits snuggly around your molds but is around twice as high. 
2. Align the top of the molds with the top of the container and attach them together.
3. Make five holes in each cube mold, each roughly 3 to 5mm in diameter. (Maybe do that before attaching the whole affair idk.)
4. Insulate the bottom and the entirety of the sides.
5. Fill the whole thing to the top with water and stick in the freezer for as long as it needs. (It might take longer to freeze completely because of the added volume of water.)

If my explanations weren't too clear, you can always search ""Clear ice molds"" on Google Images and go on from there. 

Here's why this assembly will probably work better: No matter how hard you try, 25 to 50% of your ice will end up being cloudy. That's said in the article I posted somewhere on here and your two attempts prove that. Also, you seem to have understood that the directional ferrying method pushes the impurities/bubbles/increase in pressure that prevent the ice form forming correctly towards the bottom. (Also said in the article; idk why people say it's wrong.) If you put these two things together, you have that roughly the bottom half of your total volume will be cloudy no matter what. This is why you need the extra space filled with water under your trays, with holes so that the impurities and bubbles can be pushed out of your shapes. The 50% of water that will turn into clear ice will then be in your molds.

One thing: if you see that it seems to works but not quite, you can remove the bottom of you molds completely, allowing the water to vertically move freely.

Last tip: Maybe it's just me being superstitious, but you seem to have a lot of air in your water. Try letting it sit for a few hours before freezing. Maybe it helps just a little, but don't quote me on that.",1586248438

\- 2 oz scotch  
\- 1 oz sweet vermouth  
\- 2 dashes Angostura bitters

Stir with ice and strain it into a cocktail glass ([here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Lqpslf0UyA) if you need to see an example) and garnish with a cherry.

The amount of smoke will depend on the Scotch she has -- a blended one will be great and a little smoke will come through in the drink, but a really peaty one might be too aggressive.

78,cocktails,"There are the classics that you can learn to begin. Tried and true cocktails that any decent bartender would be able to whip up. Margharita, Mojito, Whiskey Sour, Moscow Mule, Cosmopolitan, Martini, Negroni, Old Fashioned, Manhattan, Daiquiri, Caipirinha, Tom Collins, Sazerac just to name a few. If you make all of those once you will get an idea of commonly used ratios, how much liquor they all have and which style of cocktails you prefer. Then delve deeper. One thing that helped me in the beginning is a common ratio of alcohol to acid to sweet being 2:1:1. So let's say 2 parts rum, 1 part lime juice and 1 part simple syrup, plus mint and you got a delicious Mojito. If you use that ratio and sub in different alcohols, lemon or lime juice, and simple syrups (Which you make yourself - they are simple! 1:1 water and sugar dissolved in a pan. And you can flavor them.) Voila! You are making delicious drinks on the fly and it's really fun. If they are too sweet you can reduce the simple to 3/4part. Add 2oz mezcal to 1oz lemon juice and 1oz hibiscus simple syrup for one of my go-tos. Or 2oz whiskey, 1oz lemon juice, 1oz simple, and a small egg white and you have a Whiskey Sour. 

I also like drinks with bitter profiles like Negronis. They will often have an herb liquer that ads a lot of flavor and bitterness to the drink. Delightful. The world of mixology is really fun to get into, I always feel like a scientist mixing stuff up, experimenting, and exploring new flavors. 

Sorry I know you asked for specific resources, like books. I dont have any, but this sub has tons of inspiration. So just find what kind of drinks you like and start exploring that way.

 _____________________________________________

Peanut butter bourbon:

I didn‚Äôt use the technique that you‚Äôll find with a google search.  That involves spreading a thin layer of peanut butter into a dish and pouring bourbon on top.  Then it‚Äôs a waiting game.  Who‚Äôs got time for that when cocktails are on the line?!?  Ok, I do.  Just the same, I tried a suisse vide technique to speed up the process, and also impart more flavor than I expect the online recipes do.  I put the last of my peanut butter (maybe 1.5 tablespoons-ish) into a small (1 cup) mason jar.  I poured the last of my bourbon in (enough to almost fill the jar).  I put the lid on tight, and placed the jar into my slow cooker filled to the top with water.  I turned it on low, and left the lid off.  I know from previous testing that with the lid off, the water, when fully heated, gets right to suisse vide temperatures (130-140 degrees).  I let it sit in there for several hours.  Honestly, I forgot it was in there and have no idea how much time went by.  When I pulled it out, the peanut butter had broken down, and a quick shake made it evenly dispersed.  I put it in the fridge overnight, thinking it would separate.  It didn‚Äôt.  At least, not very much.  So instead I filtered it through a coffee filter.  That took several hours, but the bourbon came out clear and very peanut buttery.  The aforementioned pan method is probably a lot easier, but I got there in the end.

Rye Syrup:

This is just a simple syrup infused with caraway seeds.  I put 1 cup of water, 1 cup of sugar, and 1 tablespoon of caraway seeds into a pot.  I brought that to a boil, then turned off the heat.  I have an electric stove that holds the heat long after it‚Äôs been turned off, so I just left it on there, covered, to infuse.  When it had completely cooled, I strained out the caraway seeds.",1586214609
81,cocktails,"Depends on the ingredient! Something that might not respond well to super hot heat (flowers, some herbs, some barks) have done okay for me in the sous vide. Otherwise there‚Äôs nothing wrong with the pan.",1586214518
82,cocktails,"That‚Äôs a great idea, thanks! I‚Äôm fresh out of Campari, but fortunately my state declared liquor stores to be ‚Äúnecessary businesses‚Äù, so I‚Äôll definitely pick some up and give that a try!

Just taking the picture and uploading it probably takes more time. How is asking people to follow the rules beating a dead horse lmao

I mean, especially with this recipe? Just for a penicillin there are a whole bunch of variations(proportions, whether you're using an infusion-based syrup(if so, what's the recipe for that one?) or grated and squeezed, whether you're adding honey to the syrup or mixing the ginger syrup with a seperate honey syrup, are you misting or floating the islay, which brands are you using), and this is a specific variation which will need to be proportioned differently, will need to be experimented with to find the right balance between the honey and the ginger since the ginger beer is already sweetened, can vary a lot by brand of ginger beer(like is it fentiman's, ginger joe or schweppes?), *and* I couldn't find another recipe for a ginger beer penicillin even when I googled that phrase specifically. And even if it was a more straightforward recipe that you could find on google, you still can't know what version OP used(because let's face it, there are always variants) *and* someone who stumbles on a cocktail that looks and sounds really cool should be able to make it themselves without doing research and having to figure out which websites are good and which ones are bad. I was turned off cocktails for half a year because I used a shitty daiquiri recipe for my first daiquiri and didn't get what I did wrong. And that's not even *mentioning* variant recipes which make up a pretty large part of the posts on the sub.

But no, you're obviously a hero for standing up to the mods who want to make this ""a friendlier and more intuitive space"" by forcing poor poor OP to spend 10 seconds writing out a list of ingredients and measurments. Damn, you really saved the day from that horrible bullying.

I've always been team Bloody Mary over Team Mimosa but I'm questioning my brunch allegiance because Team Garibaldi might have both beat.  This is a really simple cocktail made from Campari and orange juice.  My advice is to use fresh squeezed stuff, not bottled.  I'd also suggest running the OJ in a blender or shaking it with a Hawthorn strainer's spring to get it nice and frothy.  ‚Å£


For this you need‚Å£:


* 1.5 oz Campari‚Å£


* 4.5 oz frothed orange juice‚Å£


 Build in glass.  First mix half the OJ with the Campari and ice and give it a lazy stir, then top with the remaining OJ.  Make sure to get some foam in there.  Garnish with an orange slice cause you gotta stay hydrated if you wanna dominate brunch. ‚Å£


If you end up using storebought OJ or the oranges you have just aren't very sweet then you might want to use a little simple syrup to sweeten it, but I like mine bitter with the natural sweetness of orange juice.‚Å£


  This classic was named after Giuseppe Garibaldi, an Italian general and one of their nation's founding fathers who contributed to the unification of Italy.  The colors of the drink are supposed to represent his supporters red uniforms and the oranges of southern Italy used to make the drink. ‚Å£

267,cocktails,"Hey, sorry for the late response! Here's my setup: [https://imgur.com/a/OiZ43aR](https://imgur.com/a/OiZ43aR)

You're right that with ice molds, it's not that simple, because if you want your mold to contain only clear ice, you need to let the impurities escape somewhere. This basically means cutting holes at the bottom of the mold. Camper's process is [here](https://www.alcademics.com/2015/01/clear-ice-cubes-using-a-tray-in-a-cooler.html); it's kinda involved.

Instead of using a mold, I just hand cut the ice with a standard kitchen knife after tempering the block of ice at room temperature for about 10-15 minutes. I've found that it actually works better than 2 inch molds since I can get ice that's a better fit with my glassware, and I can also get decently shaped ice for my highball/collins glasses.

Good luck!",1586167717
268,cocktails,"No. I explained what a ""short"" dash is. 

So, a yarai dasher historically equated 4 dashes out of the yarai to one dash out of the bottle. It used to go 4&gt;7&gt;11. Which im sure you know. 

The new yarais from cocktail kingdom have standardized the dashes to 3 dashes per 1 dash out of the bottle. 

But if you dont want a full dash, say only want a half hit out of the bottle or 1 or 2 dashes out of a yarai, I'd make an adjustment and abbreviate the dash motion so less will come out. Orange bitters are beautiful. I like to split 50/50 with Regan's and fees west India orange. However, orange bitters can take over. That's not the objective. The objective in this drink is to zip it up, give it a lift, add depth. A full dash will compromise these objectives. So an adjustment is made.

&gt; Although Cardamaro is categorized as an Amaro, it almost acts as if it's Vermouth; not to mention it is in fact wine-based. Punt e Mes happens to be in the same boat, on a side note (Vermouth acting as if it's Amaro).

&gt; Aperol is an Amaro that is often treated as a more approachable Campari.

&gt; Gin + Campari + Sweet Vermouth is *the* Negroni template; but I consider Spirit + Amaro + Vermouth template to be a suitable Negroni *template*.

-------------------------

Since all the components seem to fit the template, the only thing left for us to do is to decide the ratio.

1:1:1 is the classic ratio, but it can be too sweet.

If your palate happens to prefer drier drinks, 1:0.75:0.75 would be a much more balanced approach.

*Recipe By:* [Roger Kamholz](https://www.thekitchn.com/the-9bottle-bar-recipe-the-satans-whiskers-cocktail-recipes-from-the-kitchn-205583)

*Summary:* 

The devilishly named Satan's Whiskers cocktail is a longstanding classic, catalogued in the Savoy Cocktail Book (1930) and likely of even older vintage. It's a ""perfect"" drink, meaning that it contains equals parts of sweet and dry vermouth. The base spirit is gin, and many versions of the recipe call for orange liqueur, orange juice, and orange bitters, resulting in a rounded, layered exploration of the citrus fruit in all its bitter-juicy-sweet complexity.

*Ingredients:*

* 1 ounce gin
* 1/2 ounce sweet vermouth
* 1/2 ounce dry vermouth
* 1/2 ounce orange liqueur, (recommended: Grand Marnier or Cura√ßao. See note.)
* 1 ounce orange juice
* 1 dash orange bitters

*Directions:*

Combine the ingredients in a Boston shaker or cocktail shaker. Add ice and shake vigorously for 10 seconds. Strain the contents into a chilled cocktail glass.

*Notes:*

Mixing it with Grand Marnier, the robust, cognac-based orange liqueur, makes for ""straight"" Whiskers, while using drier orange Cura√ßao instead yields a ""curled"" one.

&amp;#x200B;

**Rye Olympic Cocktail**

*Recipe By:* Steve Cutchen

*Summary:* 

Based on Harry Craddock‚Äôs Olympic Cocktail from the 1930 Savoy Cocktail Book, it is a spirit swap from cognac to rye. It is less sweet than the Olympic and carries forward spice notes from the rye and bitters.

*Ingredients:*

* 1 ounce rye
* 1 ounce Cura√ßao
* 1 ounce orange juice
* 2 dashes orange bitters

*Directions:*

Shake with ice and strain into a cocktail glass

&amp;#x200B;

**Monkey Gland**

*Recipe By:* [Saveur Magazine](https://www.saveur.com/article/recipes/the-monkey-gland)

*Summary:* 

Credited to Harry McElhone at some point prior to 1922, the famed proprietor of Harry‚Äôs New York Bar in Paris where the Bloody Mary originated (1921, at Harry‚Äôs by Fernand Petiot), the Monkey Gland is a classic 1920s cocktail that balances gin and fresh orange juice with a splash of absinthe and a little pomegranate grenadine.

*Ingredients:*

* 2 ounces gin
* 1 ounce orange juice
* 1/4 ounce grenadine
* absinthe, (can substitute Pernod or Herbsaint)

*Directions:*

Combine gin, orange juice, and grenadine in a cocktail shaker filled with ice; shake vigorously and strain into a chilled coupe glass rinsed with absinthe. Garnish with an orange twist.

**Ward Eight**

*Recipe By:* [Esquire](https://www.esquire.com/food-drink/drinks/recipes/a3718/ward-eight-drink-recipe/)

*Summary:* 

Invented between 1918 and 1922 in the United States, perhaps in the 8th district of Washington, also known as Ward Eight.

*Ingredients:*

* 2 ounces rye
* 1 ounce lemon juice
* 1 ounce orange juice
* 1/2 ounce  grenadine, scant

*Directions:*

Shake with ice and strain into a chilled coup√© glass. 

*Notes:*

This one also makes a fine cooler: Simply strain into a Collins glass half-full of cracked ice and top to taste with club soda.",1586133998

13,cocktails,"For mine, we steeped 5 fresh Bigelow Earl Gray tea bags in approximately 24 oz of vodka for 6 hours.  It might have been a touch too long but I appreciate the intense aromatic hit of bergamot to my nose.",1586133800

15,cocktails,"Damn this is tasty.  I've made a few now. I had to make some adjustments to the drink because I didn't have any simple syrup at home and was concerned the drink would be a touch syrupy sweet, with the blackberry preserves that I had on hand, so I used Finn River raspberry wine with apple brandy in it's place.   I also was slapping the mint to release the oils.

All in all, this is friggin good!  Earl Grey infused vodka is a thing in our home now.  Thank you for introducing us to the concept and this drink.",1586133437
16,cocktails,"Juice your oranges and strain out the pulps.

Pasteurize the juice for better shelf-life (Optional).

Sweeten &amp; acidulate the juice with Oleo-Saccharum &amp; Citric Acid to taste. This should further stabilize the OJ.

You now have access to **OJ Cordial** that'll keep for a while in the fridge.

This OJ Cordial should allow you to riff essentially any drink that calls for acidulated citrus cordial. Gimlet riff?

-------------------

**Suggested Recipe:**

* *2oz OJ Cordial*
* *2 dashes Orange Bitters (Bittermens OCC recommended for this particular drink)*
* *Build over ice in a highball glass. Top with soda water.*
* *Garnish w/ a wedge of Orange (Optional)*

----------------

Now obviously the OJ Cordial's a lot of work and perhaps you want something simpler; here are some alternative suggestions.

1) Acidulate the OJ w/ Citric Acid and use that to substitute any lemon juice and/or lime juice in recipes of your interest.

2) Freeze the OJ in cubes and use 'em to shake your drinks. You're chilling and diluting with the OJ instead of water in this case so you should keep that in mind.

3) Power through your oranges with all the OJ highball drinks you can think of. Tequila Sunrise, Screwdriver, Garibaldi.. The list could go on.

4) Turn your OJ highball drinks into slushie drinks using [Dave Arnold's technique](https://youtu.be/86hMKSwiWoI). No need to add extra dilution w/ water since the OJ's already doing that for you. A little bit of acidulation through addition of lemon/lime juice is recommended, however.

5) Look for recipes that call for OJ. Frozen Negroni, Negroni Frapp√©, Painkiller, et cetera et cetera.

6) Just drink 'em.

I have a decently stocked home bar that definitely leans local [every country in this neck of the woods has a 'traditional' sweet liqueur, it seems], but I find that the gin selection is quite serviceable. Most of my favorite cocktails are based in gin. 

Buffalo Trace and Bulleit aren't hard to find, and Zacapa and Plantation work for some recipes. Sadly, the silver rum is the harder one to find at good quality.

When we can all start traveling again, I'll go back to my habit of using airport and ferry-terminal shops whenever I happen by to look for things that aren't at Alko.

It can be a bit pricey to keep up with month to month, because they send you the ingredients for unique cocktails and you buy whatever liquor that month focuses on.

Since then I found it easier to order gin and tonics with lime. Less confusing, less work for the bartender, and I always know what I‚Äôm going to get. I prefer Bombay Sapphire and Fever Tree light.

The Corpse Reviver 2 is my daily quarantini ritual since mid-March. I ordered my first at a fancy restaurant, but I can make this one at home. 3/4 oz each of gin, citronge, Lillet, lemon juice. 

Basically I like gin with citrus I guess. 

Gin used to be too flowery for me, now it‚Äôs my go-to because it doesn‚Äôt mess with my head as much as tequila or whiskey, but it has more character than vodka.",1586107595

The only way to prevent cloudy ice is by stopping the freezing process before the water in the mold(or insulated cooler) freezes completely. You then shape your crystal clear ice and you can now safely return your cubes to the freezer for storage.

And I have no idea what you mean by it needing circulation, but I promise you if you puncture the bottom molds and then try to fill them with liquid water, gravity will ensure that the space created under the molds with fill with water.

So many people have associations of gin tasting like rubbing alcohol mixed with raw potato, and there are definitely some major brands that taste awful but marketing does it magic, so I would say really focus on the style. A London Dry will taste completely different from an American Floral style just like how Bourbon and Isla Scotch have insanely different profiles. I can really recommend trying a bunch of different brands in a few different styles as if you were doing a whiskey tasting. You'll find what your preference is, what the style or preference pairs well with in mixed drinks or cocktails, or just in general you're not a gin drinker. You'll also find there's a difference in flavor between compound gins and straight distillation.

If you‚Äôve got a spare five minutes, I highly recommend taking a look through [the full video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHxpjr1_Al0).

Hope you enjoy! Hit me up with questions in the comments.

**Recipe**

* 2oz (60ml) brandy
* 0.75oz (20ml) ‚Äòsunberry syrup‚Äô
* 1 egg yolk
* Chocolate bitters

Add all ingredients to a shaker filled with ice. Shake thoroughly to chill. Discard the ice. Shake again, hard. Strain into your chosen vessel. Serve!

**Tasting notes:** Thick, rich, luxurious - exactly what you‚Äôd expect an expensive alcohol to taste like.

**Best paired with:** More Sunshine.

Been making a modified gimlet with it and it‚Äôs quite amazing. 1.5oz gin, 1oz lime, 1/4oz simple, 3/4 oz maraschino liqueur, shaken, strained, served up. 

There‚Äôs really so much out there for gin cocktails it‚Äôs pretty amazing. Bees knees is an amazing simple one if you like honey and lemon. Aviation is also amazing if you can get your hands on maraschino liquor and creme de violette. 

For rum, if you‚Äôre also going down that road as well, there‚Äôs a few there that come to mind. I know you were saying light rum which is fine, but dark rums actually tend to be sweeter and richer. Up to you obv, but I highly recommend. As for cocktails, Daiquiris all day. Can mix in fruit into the shake to mix it up too! 2 oz rum, 1oz lime, 1/2oz simple, shaken with ice. Served up.  If you‚Äôre gonna do fruit, muddle it into the shaker with the rum and give it a sec to soak in. Then shake it really well till the ice is all crushed in the tins.

This drink is called ""Texas Hold Me"". It's delightfully strong, nutty, earthy, and spicy.  It definitely feels like a drink a cowboy would love. Here are the specs:


1 oz coffee infused bourbon

1 oz @anchoreyes chili liqueur 

1/4 oz roasted walnut orgeat

3/4 oz lemon juice

Garnish:

Orange peel 

Toasted Walnut


Add all ingredients to a shaker with ice. (Make the 1/4 oz of walnut orgeat a fat 1/4 oz, it is truly delicious) Shake until chilled, then double strain into a rocks glass with fresh ice. Express an orange peel and garnish. I also added a toasted, sugared walnut because I had a huge bag of walnuts I needed to use.


Wow, I love this drink! This was my first time making my own orgeat and I was pleasantly surprised with how easy it was, and I already had all the ingredients on hand! My bf bought a 3lb bag of walnuts (I'm pretty sure it was a panic-buy) and I was already looking for a way to use them when I stumbled upon this recipe.

91,cocktails,"OK so here's my first try take on what I have and what I received.

Campari: Citrusy, ""red"", harsh earthy bitterness on the finish.

Meletti Bitter: not quite as sweet as the amaro or Campari, clove, anise, menthol. Bitter finish but nowhere near as intense as Campari. Very  balanced and pleasant. Makes me want to make everything Campari was too strong for.

Meletti Amaro: more intense clove, cinnamon, anise, hint of menthol. Sweeter than the bitter and more viscous than the Monte. I think it would make an awesome rye Manhattan split with sweet or dry vermouth.

Amaro Montenegro: thin, medium sweet, herbal. There's more going on but I can't quite identify it. 


I need a citrusy amaro/bitter now that isn't Campari. Also need some recipes for these new acquisitions.",1586038629

95,cocktails,"Scotch &amp; Soda is my favorite highball. Had a coupe last night with Famous Grouse. Try these steps if you like:

First, chill your glass in the freezer until it's super frosty before building the drink. The cold might help keep things carbonated longer.

Second, get yourself an ice spear molds. Having one big rectangular cube in the Collins glass is aesthetically pleasing, at least to me.

Third, when pouring the soda, do so in the space between the ice and the glass directly into the Scotch. The soda loses a bit of carbonation if it comes into contact with the ice.

Finally, my technique is to express the oils of a lemon twist into the empty, chilled glass *before* adding my two ounces of whisky. This a bit of lemon flavor to the finished highball. I know you said you use orange peel, but I think that goes better with bourbon and rye and Scotch pairs better with lemon. Give it a try &amp; enjoy!",1586038008

If you've never been to Texas then bear with me here.  This local favorite is less hidden valley and more hidden gem.   Ranch water is a simple mix of Blanco tequila, lime juice, and soda water. The refreshing highball should be your new go-to for patio drinking this summer, especially if you've ever said the words ""skinny marg"" and been serious.‚Å£
‚Å£

  I suggest using a respectable 100% agave tequila like Olmeca Altos or Espolon as they're both affordable and authentic. Most Texans will also tell you that you've got to use Topo Chico for your soda water.  Finally, I like to add just a bit of sweetness to mine with a bar spoon of lime oleo sacchrum, but purists would protest that. ‚Å£

I love a good Whisky Sour ü•É but we not only upgrade it to a New York Sour (or Manhattan Sour), but we also Milk ü•õ washed it to get that sweet clarification process.

The clarification allows for a crystal clear cocktail that is silky smooth on the tongue, it is really a treat!

And for the New York Sour transformation, you simply need to float some Claret Red Wineüç∑ (or Bordeaux) on top of the drink to get that nice red layer.
This adds some acidity and fruity notes to the cocktail and for the better, it is delicious!

Here is the recipe for a non Clarified New York Sour:
6 cl Bourbon ü•É
3 cl lemon üçã
1,5 cl Maple Syrup üçÅ
Optionally, 1,5 cl egg white ü•ö

373,cocktails,"This recipe for the mojito is a little atypical but we find it provides the most consistent and delicious results. Instead of muddling mint, lime, and sugar together, we follow a daiquiri template with the addition of mint. We add a couple of dashes of angostura bitters to tie everything together and a little more complexity. 

I believe it is also the same recipe listed in the Death &amp; Co. book!

&amp;#x200B;

* 0.75oz of a 2:1 simple syrup
* 7-9 mint leaves, muddled with the syrup
* 1oz freshly squeezed lime juice
* 2oz white or aged rum
* 2-3 dashes of angostura bitters
* Short shake with crushed ice to incorporate the ingredients
* Dirty dump into a Collins glass
* Top with crushed ice if necessary
* Garnish with a mint sprig and lime

1 (ish) part pineapple juice

395,cocktails,"I ask because it‚Äôs easy to say ‚Äòthis is what you need for cocktail basics‚Äô but everyone is going to have their own tastes. It‚Äôs really easy to buy stuff that you‚Äôll use once, so knowing what you like or want, will help you make smarter decisions. 

If you like smoke you probably want to look at bourbons or mezcals as base spirits, knowing that you can build out from there. I‚Äôm not much of a bourbon drinker so I won‚Äôt be any help there but  for mezcal you definitely would want to get a triple sec, works for bourbon too, maybe a fruit liquor to add to those, a cognac or schnapps or even a Creme of some sort. Point is buy smart or you‚Äôll end up with a ton of stuff you don‚Äôt need. 

Vodka tends to be the easiest spirit for people who don‚Äôt know what a cocktail should taste like to drink because it‚Äôs so plain (which makes it hard to mix wrong). If you‚Äôre making proper drink I cannot imagine anyone will ask you where the vodka is.

Good news being that you don't necessarily need a Fino. Both a Manzanilla or a Palo Cortado would be a very easy 1 for 1 substitute without changing the overall profile of the drink and if you're willing to play around with the specs and lower the sugar content from other areas you can play with more aggresive drys like an Olorosso.",1585968428

9,cocktails,"I understand and fully appreciate what you're trying to build here.  Bravo!  However, I see too many variables involved for accuracy **and** consumers' ease-of-use.  It really comes down to portion size and ABV.

The US federal government established long ago that a single serving of 40% ABV spirits is 1 1/2 oz (45ml) or 18ml of pure ethanol.  However, there are no laws in the States mandating specific serving sizes.  One bar may use a 1 1/2 oz (45ml) pour of gin for their 5:1 martini, while another may use a 2 1/2 oz (75ml)  pour of gin.  Same goes for an Old Fashioned or Manhattan.  Even a simple highball will vary, depending on the ""standard pour"" of the establishment.

Also consider the individual ABV of the spirit **actually poured**.  An Old Fashioned can very easily be made with 40%, 50% or higher ABV whiskey.  The same goes for Martinis, Manhattans, Daiquiris, etc.  How will you account for varying ABVs and serving sizes?  Certain spirits are are *typically* fairly consistent in their ABV; Tequila, Scotch and Cognac for example.  Vodka, gin, American whiskey and especially rum can vary **greatly**.  Beer can vary from 3% ABV to 14ish%.  Serving sizes, again, vary greatly.

The best I can see you doing is working with *someone's* standards on ABV and serving size, while announcing that what the customer is actually served may be very different from what your app tells them. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø

I wish I could be of more help to you!

\~Good luck!

&amp;#x200B;

ETA:   Why does serving size and ABV matter?  A 2:1 Manhattan (2 parts American whiskey to 1 part sweet vermouth):

* Made with 45ml of 40% rye and 22ml of sweet vermouth will contain 21.5 ml of pure ethanol.
* Made with 75ml of 50% ABV (bottled-in-bond) rye and 37ml of sweet vermouth contains 43.5ml of pure ethanol.

The second Manhattan contains more than **TWICE** the amount of alcohol.",1585954755

\- Dash Angustura Orange bitters

\- Dash Scrappy's Firewater

\- Tajin chili lime powder

&amp;#x200B;

Muddle 2 large or 4 medium basil leaves in shaker with the lime juice. Mix rest of the ingredients (other than the tajin) into shaker with ice, shake, strain, pour. Top with Tajin powder. Not particularly fancy but really interesting flavors.

\*Salted cucumber juice is a byproduct of making a German style cucumber salad. The cucumbers are sliced then salted in a bowl and left to sit to pull the moisture out, the salted cucumber water is what's left in the bowl.

If you can't tell I like it spicy. The recipe can be dumbed down a bit for simplicity sake. You could ditch the bitters, the Tajin and the basil, or swap the Ancho for Triple Sec if any of these aren't available to you.

All you've got do is put it in a swing top beer bottle and leave it out for an extra day to ferment some more, then refrigerate it to stop the fermentation like you normally would.

71,cocktails,"This is my second installment of Will it Booze. I attempted to make a concha flavored liqueur. Remember, in order for it to successfully booze, it has to taste like its inspiration and be able to be used in a cocktail.

To make the liqueur, pour two cups of 151 vodka into a jar and add ~1.5 vanilla beans, shaking a couple times a day. On the 3rd day, add about a teaspoon of whole cloves, continue the daily shaking. On day 5, throw in one cinnamon stick. I didn't add them all at the same time because cinnamon and clove can be very overpowering compared to vanilla. Given that conchas are fairly mild in flavor, I wanted to infuse the stronger flavors for less time. On the sixth day, strain the infused liquor into a glass bowl and mix in 1/3c of melted butter, about half salted and half unsalted, cover and refrigerate overnight. Finally, strain out the butter using a coffee filter. To lower the abv to about 40%, mix with 1.5c of plain or vanilla simple syrup. This was where I hit a snag. My end product ended up too vanilla forward. I would either use a plain simple syrup or use less vanilla if making a flavored syrup.

So, to answer will it booze? Kind of? It doesn't taste as much like a concha as I wanted it to, mainly because of the extra vanilla. If I made the suggested adjustments, I think it'd be perfect. However, it DOES work in the cocktail I made. A variant of the Brandy Alexander, it's equal parts Concha, creme de cacao, and cream, wet shaken, strained, and topped with cinnamon and clove. I'm calling it a Concha Alejandro.",1585946999

2 Dickel Rye

.75 Thyme Simple

.5 Fresh Blood Orange

.5 Lemon

Egg white

Last housemate apparently left Rosemary, Thyme, Sage, 2 Mints, and other herbs that recently sprouted up enormously. So I made many simples for my home bar. 

I had to use equal parts lemon to blood orange as the Blood Orange didn‚Äôt have enough flavor for solo. 

I used a dry shake, to wet shake and double strain. I prefer both depending on drink and whose drinking it if I know their preference. I learned that in this sub. Thanks everyone for tips.",1585939405

If it's not totally clear or if it's above 25% ABV, I add it before the final pass. If it's totally clear and below, I add it after the final pass and before passing it through a coffee filter upon bottling. More spiritous stuff will really overpower the rest of the punch, hence why I add it before the final pass.

You will generally notice you don't need to add much reflavoring ingredients proportionally to achieve the flavor balance you want. In my milk-punch version of a 20th Century cocktail (definitely my favorite one so far), I only added about a third of the Kina and Creme de Cacao that it would normally take.",1585934886

Since you asked...

It didn't solidify as well as I'd hoped. It basically turned into a slush overnight. I found this weird, since it normally solidifies on its own at just below 20C

So I treated it more like an immersion extraction, like making orgeat, to get a coconut liqueur instead. I strained through a cheese cloth, and added some homemade coco lopez to sweeten it a bit.

So now I have a higher quality ""Malibu"" style liqueur. I have no idea about the ABV, but it smells and tastes like (how I remember) Malibu to be. Looks even nicer since it's an opaque white.

Almonds (in the french press) are toasted in the oven at 300F for 20 minutes.

Volumes in the picture are doubled from the recipe, because my french press is too big and I'd rather drink two of these with one prep than with two preps.

* 2oz Cutty Sark Prohibition Edition Blended Scotch Whisky (I substitued with Chivas because I had it on hand)
* 1.25oz Tio Pepe Fino Sherry
* 0.75oz peach simple syrup
* 0.75oz lemon juice

Combined in a cocktail shaker with ice, shaken vigorously untill chilled and diluted, then strained into the french press pot.  French press pot contains 8g toasted almonds, 5 peach half-moon slices, and 1 fresh thyme sprig.

Cocktail is allowed to steep for at least three minutes, then the plunger is depressed and it is poured into a glass.",1585875023

Really high end craft bartenders might be an exception, but even so, it's so common for employees to move around from bar to bar (partly to broaden one's experience, partly a grass is greener mentality) that keeping employees is probably not even on anyone's radar right now.

21,cocktails,"Hi! The tl;dr is ice has a natural tendency to want to form a perfect crystal structure. This means that when water freezes, the trapped gases/impurities get pushed into the non-frozen part. In a normal freezing situation, freezing happens from all directions, so the impurities get pushed into the center of the cube. The method that I'm using attempts to insulate the block from all sides except for one, so that the impurities can get pushed out to the edge of the block. I then take the ice block out before it's completely frozen, to avoid getting the impurities into the ice block. (You can also just cut it off.)

Ice straight out of the freezer is going to be very hard and very cold. Sometimes called crack cold, meaning that it will thermally stress in room temperature liquids and crack, and it's also more brittle and easier to crack with a bar spoon.

There are two reasons to temper ice, aesthetics and dilution. For aesthetics, all of the fancy ultra clear ice you see is usually very shiny and slightly wet looking because it's tempered, as to not crack when placed in a drink. For dilution, it's important because when comparing tempered and untempered while stirring or shaking the same amount of time, the amount of water introduced can be off by a cL or more.",1585852477

When I was still mathing out the ingredients, I had a 2.5 pt milk content to 12.1 total punch. I ended up with 2:11.1 instead.

This punch used my old set-up of nested colanders. I did something stupid (put the rum and pistachio oil in a blender to emulsify) and ended up with an extra cloudy starting mix, hence why I had to pass it through four times. But that's also why this one is clearer than usual.",1585845223

182,cocktails,"Thats just really hard to answer because it really depends on the conditions in which you are making the drink.  The size and density of the ice you're working with is a huge factor.  You have to continually taste your drinks as you learn and develop a ""feel"" for shaking and stirring.  One summer I worked on a boat at an outside bar.  It was hot and humid as fuck but super shwanky and the guests expected high quality cocktails.  I had to really rethink the order in which i built drinks and how I would build them.  Stirred drinks I would basically just stir 3 or 4 times to mix the ingredients.  If I stirred anymore in that heat the drink would just be water.  


I think you want a rule of thumb.  I'll give you one but I just wanted to clarify that this isn't a ""rule"" it's a starting point because it really depends on what you're working with.  Shake your cocktails for 30 seconds and stir your drinks 40 times.  TASTE TASTE TASTE",1585841316

198,cocktails,"Absolutely. Because milk washing strips out so many flavonoids (which are phenolic compounds like tannins), I find the end result is usually too muted. To combat that, I build up a small reserve of clear ingredients to add to the final punch and bring back some of those lost flavors. In this case I infused fresh pineapple into overproof rum for a few days, strained it out, then treated it with Pectinex, a pectinase enzyme complex. The enzyme breaks down plant matter bonds to compounds in the liquid, so it will naturally fall as sediment. I use a centrifuge to speed up this process and have crystal-clear pineapple rum.

In this case I added all the reserved liquid after the third pass and before the final pass. Milk clarification is an additive process: a little more of the phenolic compounds bind to the casein proteins with each pass. A little more clear each time, and a little less flavorful. Adding before the final pass means I lose less flavor and I keep the clarity I've achieved.",1585837665

Here's my recipe. This is about my twenty-fifth milk punch experiment, and I've learned a lot. I am happy to try to answer any troubleshooting questions anyone has about milk punches.

  

**Rasta Bird**

1 part = 750ml

‚Äî1.3 part pineapple-infused Plantation OFTD (treat with pectinase, clarify and reserve) (1L liquid after, reserve half) (let‚Äôs call it 48% abv)  
‚Äî1 part pistachio-oil-washed Appleton Signature (40% abv)   
‚Äî1 part pistachio-oil-washed Cruzan blackstrap rum (40% abv)  
‚Äî2 parts fresh pineapple juice  
‚Äî1.3 parts Campari (1L) (reserve half) (20%)  
‚Äî1 part lime juice (750 ml)  
‚Äî1.5 parts demerara green tea, inc. 300g demerara sugar; 1125ml tea + 300g sugar  
‚Äî2 parts whole milk (2.5:12.1 is 1:4.8, which is ideal)  
‚ÄîHalf oz Ango bitters  
‚Äî2 drops 20% saline solution per 6-oz yield, so 90 drops saline

Roughly 15.1% ABV, 0.87% acid. I don't have a proper Brix measurement because of the pineapple juice and infusion into the rum.

**Notes**:

I was happy with the flavor on this one. The Cruzan blackstrap has that signature pancake-syrup flavor (which I believe is artificial), and that survived the milk washing well, as did the strong bitterness from the Ango and Campari. So the flavors weren't as muted as they normally are in milk punches. Also I'm happy with the density/viscosity and clarity: lots of milk punches can be a bit watery, but you can see here the swirls in the liquid. I took the picture with my Upper West Side north-facing view so you could see the clarity.

This one was slower-going with straining: it took me four passes to get this clarity. But on the upside, there was no chill haze after refrigeration or sediment that gathered at the bottom of the bottle. So the extra passes were worth it.

Another cocktail from my SO's food and drinks blog. This one is a blood and sand variation, and one of the earlier concoctions during this quarantine.

Ingredients

* 25 ml Bourbon
* 25 ml Sweet Vermouth
* 25 ml Kumquat Liquor
* 25 ml Blood Orange Juice
* 1 Egg White use a small egg, if you only have big eggs then use half the white

Instructions

* Add all ingredients to a cocktail shaker with 2-3 ice cubes and shake hard until the egg white foams up, or the ice cubes have melted. You don't have to add ice if you don't want to dilute it, but I did.
* Pour into a cocktail or coupe glass. Garnish with a blood orange slice and rosemary sprig.

Some details about the different alcohols and why he crafted it this way are on his blog.

A popular story goes that the El Presidente was invented by the American bartender Eddie Wolke while working at the Jockey Club in Havana and named it in reference to President Gerardo Machado. However, this is most likely untrue, as the El Presidente can be found before Wolke‚Äôs arrival in Cuba and before Machado‚Äòs presidency in John Escalante‚Äôs 1915 book *Manual del Cantinero*. Therefore, it is more likely that the cocktail was named after president Mario Garc√≠a Manocal. While David Embury referred to the El Presidente as a cousin of a Daiquiri using vermouth rather than citrus, David Wondrich has dubbed the drink the ‚ÄúCubanized answer to the Manhattan‚Äù. The drink is often mistakenly made using dry vermouth, when the preferred vermouth in Cuba during the early twentieth century was made from Chamb√©ry grapes and was therefore more similar to blanc vermouth like Dolin.",1585792904

So many people remarked on how simple and elegant the drink is (we do other little things too, primarily not muddling anything), and now that we're selling Old Fashioneds in pints and quarts to-go during this epidemic it's been so pleasing (or maybe career threatening? haha) to hear back from people who follow the instructions on the little bit of tape we apply to the bottle and go, ""Ah!

387,cocktails,I have some skrewball currently. I‚Äôve never tried a homemade peanut butter fat washed whiskey but I will say Skrewball is pretty good. My only issue is it is very sweet to me so I can‚Äôt have too much of it straight and I would imagine in things like your drink you have to factor in other ingredients sweetness and maybe give a little more acidity to cut it.,1585787952
388,cocktails,Usually i do too but i wanted to get a stronger flavor into the drink to make up for the lack of taste from the gordons. Our mint from the garden has this weird zesty taste that ive never tasted in store bought mint which made for a nice addition to the taste,1585787880

398,cocktails,"I used about 20 dried flower heads to make about 3-1/2 or 4 cups of water. Of the water doesn't look deep blue, toss in a few more flower heads.

Also, crushing the ice will result in a quicker reaction. If you use while cubes and want a quicker reaction then you can also spoon in a little of the blue water. I keep a batch in a squeeze bottle in the fridge.

And finally, I don't recommend butterfly pea flower ice balls if you want a quick reaction. I tried that first, and while the ice balls were gorgeous they melt very slowly so there is little color change. They're great as a blue centerpiece to a drink but that's all.",1585785198

1,cocktails,Agreed,1585769631
2,cocktails,"I've done some coconut oil washed whiskey in the past and wanted to branch out a little. Most recipes call for spreading a layer of peanut butter in a dish, then pouring the whiskey over it and letting it steep that way. I wanted to make a small batch, so I put .75 cups peanut butter and 2 cups whiskey in a jar and stirred it together, then strained it through a coffee filter. 

It seems to have worked OK. PB was a little more challenging than coconut oil because coconut oil very handily will solidify into a disc on top of the whiskey at room temp, while PB turned into an easy to disturb sludge. It's also a little less efficient because the PB was unusable after washing (it tasted harsh and textually was pretty gross) while coconut oil was improved by the washing process. 

There's more burn than I expected, but tons of peanut aroma and flavor. I did use conventional peanut butter and want to try again with a natural one to see if it helps reduce some of the harshness.

I haven't actually tried Skrewball, but given the difficulty and waste involved with making my own (and the fact that Skrewball is only $24) I'd like to try it.

87,cocktails,"Spending the week at home, I found myself turning to cocktails for an artistic outlet. I got it out of my system, now it's time to eat and drink healthy to protect the immune system. Here are the recipes:

1. Fresh Squeezed Lemonade

Squeeze fresh lemon juice, add simple syrup and water to desired strength and sweetness.

Steep a handful of butterfly pea flowers in boiling water for 10 minutes. Chill, then make ice cubes. Serve lemonade over crushed ice. Melting ice will react with citric acid in the lemon juice to change the color of the drink.

This drink provides a beautiful and refreshing base if you want to add some vodka or other spirit.

\-----------------------

2) Vodka Tonic with mint, lime and cucumber

\- 1-1/2 oz vodka

\- 1/2 small lime

\- 1 tsp caster sugar (optional)

\- 5-6 mint leaves

\- 5-6 cucumber slices

\- Tonic Water

\- butterfly pea flower tea

&amp;#x200B;

Muddle lime, sugar and mint in a shaker.

Add vodka and cucumber. Shake well.

Strain over ice. Add cucumber slices from shaker to the glass.

Add tonic water (amount as desired) and stir.

Top with butterfly pea flower tea for color change.

\-----------------------

3) Bushwhacker

\- ¬Ω oz rum

\- ¬Ω oz vodka (optional - if not used, double the rum)

\- ¬Ω oz Baileys Irish Cream

\- ¬Ω oz Kahlua

\- ¬Ω oz Amaretto

\- ¬Ω oz chocolate liqueur

\- ¬Ω oz Hazelnut liqueur

\- ¬Ω oz Creme de coconut\*

\- 1 cup crushed ice (adjust for consistency)

\- Chocolate syrup for garnish

&amp;#x200B;

Blend all ingredients until consistency is like a milkshake

Pour into large hurricane glass drizzled with chocolate syrup

\* Creme de coconut

\- 400 ml Coconut milk

\- 1-¬º cups sugar

\- ‚Öõ tsp salt

Combine all the ingredients into a pot and gently heat and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Pour into a squeeze bottle for convenience

\-----------------------

4) Aperol Sour

\- 2 oz Aperol

\- 3/4 oz Fresh Lemon Juice

\- 3/4 oz Simple Syrup (1:1)

\- 1 Egg White

&amp;#x200B;

Dry shake the egg white with one ice cube.

Add the remaining ingredients to cocktail shaker.

Shake &amp; double strain into a chilled coupe glass.

Garnish with a twist of grapefruit (I had no fresh fruit for garnishing).

\-----------------------

5) Frozen Pina Colada

\- 2 oz White rum

\- 3 oz Pineapple juice

\- 1-¬Ω oz Creme de coconut

\- ¬º oz Fresh lime juice

\- 4 cups Crushed ice (adjust for consistency)

&amp;#x200B;

Blend all ingredients until smooth. Add ice as necessary.

Pour into hurricane glass. Garnish with maraschino cherry and pineapple wedge.

\-----------------------

6) Bangkok East Side

\- 2 oz dry gin

\- 1/2 small lime (plus wedge for garnish)

\- 1/2 tsp caster sugar (optional)

\- 5-6 mint leaves

\- 1-3 cucumber slices (plus slices for garnish) (depends on how strong a cucumber flavor you prefer)

\- Tonic Water

\- Butterfly pea flower ice cubes

&amp;#x200B;

Muddle lime, sugar, cucumber and mint in a shaker.

Add gin and ice. Shake well.

Strain over ice (half regular cubes, half butterfly pea flower cubes).

Add tonic water (amount as desired) and stir.

Garnish with cucumber slices and lime wedge.

My dad nearly choked, and if looks could kill, my mother would've been charged -- although likely not convicted -- for murder 2. I would've gone to my grave very satisfied.",1585748965

120,cocktails,"So my SO has been making lots of cocktails during our quarantine. This is one of my new favorites from this past week. He called it the Black Latvian since it uses Riga Black Balsam Blackcurrant which is a popular liquor in Eastern Europe. 

 

* 50 ml Riga Black Balsam Blackcurrant
* 25 ml London Dry Gin
* 25 ml Luxardo Maraschino Liquor
* 30 ml Tonic Water
* 2 Blueberries garnish
* 1 sprig Rosemary garnish

146,cocktails,"I would respectfully disagree about the use of egg white in a sour in the sense that I'd say its compulsory. I'd also assume a sour would be served in rocks glass on ice and not straight up. I'm old school and would always serve with maraschino cherry. But I'd happily order a daiquiri at your bar any day mate as that's my tipple. Also, I'd be interested to know the authors recipe for the above post as I dont think hes posted it yet!",1585730423
147,cocktails,"Yup yup - A sour means lemon and sugar.  That‚Äôs why you have a daiquiri and a gimlet and a vodka gimlet.  They are different names due to different citrus but a rum sour, a gin sour, a vodka sour, a whiskey sour, a mezcal sour all mean lemon and sugar.  

It can have an egg white and it commonly does but it‚Äôs called a sour regardless of if it has one or not.  It‚Äôs the archetype of drink and the family it belongs to. 

If you came into my bar and asked me for a gin sour I would ask if you want egg white or not but I would not assume either way. Point being there‚Äôs a lot of personal preference that comes in to having egg white in a drink and so calling a drink with an egg white one thing and without another doesn‚Äôt really work.  Because some people have never even heard of egg white drinks but they drink gin sours or whiskey sours.  

The egg white is absolutely non-essential to the cocktail.  It has a utility and a purpose for sure, but it‚Äôs not a requirement to call something a sour. 

I hope that‚Äôs easy enough to follow and makes more or less some sense.",1585729869

159,cocktails,"Since being laid off, I have had a little free time, I have been trying to make it educational. Instead of relying on the same four or five cocktails we always drink, I went through Death &amp; Co, and marked every cocktail that I could make with our home bar (which is fairly comprehensive, but not exhaustive) and set about rating them.  
  
I started by making as many of the syrups and homebrew components as I could, this includes - **Syrups:** grenadine, demerara syrup, espresso demerara syrup, cane sugar syrup, acacia honey syrup, ginger syrup, vanilla syrup, cinnamon bark syrup, orgeat, **Infusions:** falernum and allspice dram (as neither are available for purchase in Alberta), chamomile rye, cacao nib campari, fuji apple scotch, ancho chile vermouth, pineapple rum, apricot scotch, snap pea gin, and szechuan peppercorn gin.  
  
From there, instead of making the same old, same old, I am trying to find drinks I really enjoy and want to come back to, but also looking for drinks for my fiancee. She drinks almost exclusively gin cocktails, never stirred, usually on the citrusy end of the spectrum. This presents a moderate challenge, as she won't touch agave spirits, whiskey, and most grape based spirits. Pisco has been very well received lately, as have many rum based cocktails, but that usually depends on the rum (Lily's Cartel, Sea B3, Get Lucky, Julius Orange) I have even managed to sneak in a few stirred cocktails (usually with pisco as the base) that have been solid contenders (Soul Clench, Sweet Hereafter, Little Sparrow)  
  
I am really enjoying working my way through a whole array of new drinks, and getting to put our little home bar through its paces. We are definitely still missing a few things that are high on my list: strega, cynar, ramazzotti, pierre ferrand 1840 and grande ambre cognac, cherry heering, redbreast 12, creme de cacao, creme de peche de vigne and creme yvette, but a few of these simply aren't available here, so I am looking for suitable substitutes.

1.5 - 2oz of good white rum (Flor de Cana 4yr is a great value  /  .5oz freshly-squeezed lime juice. If you have a strainer, strain through and measure .5oz. reserve two or three lime wedges each about 1/8 size of lime  /  .75oz simple syrup (equal parts sugar and water by weight or volume, brought briefly to a light simmer and stir to integrate, remove and cool)  /  10-12 mint leaves. To me, the more the merrier.

Place mint at bottom of Collins glass. Pour in syrup and place the lime wedges to cover the mint. muddle very gently just a few times. Mint releases its flavors very easily, and muddling too much will release bitter compounds (if the leaves break up, you‚Äôve overdone it). Just a few gentle presses on the lime wedges to protect the mint will do.  Fill with rum and .5oz lime juice. Add crushed ice half way and swizzle (hold a bar spoon between both palms and mode the palms back and forth, rotating the spoon vigorously in your hands. Top with 1-2oz chilled club soda. Top with more ice, take a plume or mint, slap it between your palms, and place it on top of the drink. Ramp down the ice a bit with a straw. Savor!",1585708394

* 2 oz Bourbon (I use Buffalo Trace)
* 3/4 oz Lemon Juice

Method: Add all ingredients to a shaker tin, add ice, and strain through a fine mesh strainer into a chilled rocks glass filled with ice.

""Smoked"" Salt &amp; Pepper Honey Syrup:

Mix 250g Honey and 125g Hot Water. Add 1 scorched sprig of rosemary and 1 tsp. Islay Scotch, as well as a pinch of Kosher salt and a few cracks of black pepper. Let infuse for \~1 hour and strain through a fine mesh sieve. 

**Notes:**

I love adding flavor in where I can, whether it's split-basing two sweeteners (honey and maple) to layer complexity, infusing syrups or spirits with complimentary flavors, or adding bitters that compliment and lift the star flavors of the cocktail (adding lavender to add a floral note in addition to honey and the black pepper).

the orange really pops, and it's full strength (80 proof). the recipe i'm using now is very different from what i've used with other orange liqueurs, and i've tried a lot: 1.5z tequila (i use Altos for margaritas), 1z lime juice, .5z Naranja.

it also comes in liter, and where i am the price for a liter is less than any orange liqueur i'd consider using, so it goes a long way given that i use less of it per.",1585691571

459,cocktails,"So there are a couple kinds of gin. You're into a London Dry Gin which means it's very juniper-focused and less sweet than some gins can be. You're going to get strong juniper and herbs, Bombay sapphire is one of my favorites and is about as juniper as gin gets. On the other side you've got gin that's more citrus forward and less juniper flavored. My favorite example of this is a brand Ohio has called Watershed 4 peel. This gin has far more emphatic citrus flavor that really comes through. You've also got Plymouth gin which is somewhere in between and could really be considered its own category.

Then there's old tom gin, an older pre-prohibition style that disappeared for a long time but recently made a comeback. This style is sweeter and aged in barrels oftentimes and lends itself more easily to certain cocktails which call for a smoother, sweeter gin. A martinez or a negroni for example may do well with it.

There's also genever, which I'm spelling incorrectly I think. This is the precursor to gin and is something that originated in a Scandinavian country I believe. It's a more earthy version of gin that can be really nice as well.

While I wouldn't say that gin has as much variance as whiskey, it still has many forms and each brand definitely tastes different depending on the botanicals infused as well as other ingredients such as citrus peel.

If you want a good budget gin, Beefeater is the universal champion for that category without doubt. Other notable gins would be Hendrix with cucumber notes, botanist/vim and petal with huge herbal flavors, tanquray/Bombay classic London Dry, Ransom old tom with some barrel notes and sweetness, bols genever with its earthiness, ophir with big Indian spices.

I'm a die-hard Last Word (and riff) guy, and I had my doubts about this. But I stand very much corrected. I just made this to accompany doing my Census.

The other was Leopold Bros. Aperitivo. It made a much better negroni than the Capalletti. But it wasn't quite the same as campari. It is excellent mixed with vermouth though.

The Elysian is an aromatic and flavor rich drink with lasting notes of apple that makes it a dry yet flavourful and rich drink.



Right before the quarantine we had the luck to visit the Calvados countryside (France) and once in lock down I had everything at my disposal to make this wonderful drink.

Our choice ended on a Calvados ""Hors d'√¢ge"", meaning that it is 6 years old or more (6 in that case) which start being a really good quality and develops a lot more finesse in taste whereas a younger one would be more harsh and alcohol driven.



Here is the recipe:

6 cl Calvados
1,5 cl Martini Rosso Sweet Vermouth
1,5 cl Martini Extra Dry Vermouth
0,75 cl Maple Syrup

[bitters dashes are assuming you‚Äôre dashing from the bottle it comes in. If using a Japanese dasher, multiply by 2-3)

*Old Fashioned*

2 dashes angostura bitters

1 tsp 2:1 Demerara syrup

2 oz bourbon

Orange peel garnish 


*Bee‚Äôs Knees*

3/4 oz lemon juice

3/4 oz honey syrup 

2 oz London dry gin


*Vieux Carr√®*

2 dashes angostura bitters 

2 dashes Peychaud‚Äôs bitters

1 oz rye

1 oz cognac

3/4 oz sweet vermouth 

1/4 oz Benedictine 

Lemon peel garnish (express/discard)


*Last Word*

3/4 oz Lime juice

3/4 oz Maraschino Liqueur 

3/4 oz Green Chartreuse

3/4 oz London Dry Gin 


*Paper Plane*

3/4 oz Lemon Juice

3/4 oz Aperol

3/4 oz Amaro Nonino

3/4 oz bourbon

1/4 oz 1:1 simple syrup

3/4 oz Lemon Juice

1 oz Cointreau

1.5 oz Cognac

Big thing, coconut milk is NOT the same as cream of coconut which is what you want for either drink.

Pour all ingredients into liter ISI Whipper. Chill in freezer for one hour. Charge the ISI Whipper with a single N2O charger, shake vigorously for 10 seconds. Dispense cocktail into glass and reserve ISI Whipper in refrigerator. Garnish with grated nutmeg and a maraschino cherry.

I love milkshakes, and I love cocktails, but I really hate boozy milkshakes. They are often times too heavy, rich, and thick for me to finish. From a service perspective, they are also impractical - there really is no way to produce them quickly, which costs bartenders money when serving a busy bar. Nitrogenating the milkshake in an ISI whipper solves all of these problems. Once nitrogenated, the body of the cocktail is significantly improved; it‚Äôs now a much lighter, easier drinking milkshake. The use of the ISI whipper also speeds up the speed of service - a full liter of cocktails can be batched at once, saving the bartenders time. This is really the only way I would consider using making boozy milkshakes, at home or at a bar.

* Reduce gin to 1.5 oz and add .5 oz of cognac = Stay Up Late (Stork Club Cocktail from 1946)
* Remove Club Soda for Champagne (maybe augment the measurements a touch) = gin French 75 (glassware = flute or coupe)

Now, there might be some general rules that apply to all cocktails, in much the same way that there might be some general rules that apply to all beer, all music, or all food, but to go beyond those rules, which are probably pretty vague (as in the need for ""balance,"" for instance), there's no alternative but to learn the rules of each individual practice.

Still, if there are general rules that apply to all cocktails, and a Negroni is a good cocktail by those standards, then there might be something more to be said about the function of vermouth in the drink than just ""That's how it's done."" That's why I think the suggestion by /u/chadparkhill to experiment is spot-on, even if it's true that a mix of just gin and Campari wouldn't qualify as a Negroni.",1585593814

I love milkshakes, and I love cocktails, but I really hate boozy milkshakes. They are often times too heavy, rich, and thick for me to finish. From a service perspective, they are also impractical - there really is no way to produce them quickly, which costs bartenders money when serving a busy bar. Nitrogenating the milkshake in an @isiculinary whipper solves all of these problems. Once nitrogenated, the body of the cocktail is significantly improved; it‚Äôs now a much lighter, easier drinking milkshake. The use of the ISI whipper also speeds up the speed of service - a full liter of cocktails can be batched at once, saving the bartenders time. This is really the only way I would consider using making boozy milkshakes, at home or at a bar.

I had some thoughts though. I think the original Death &amp; Co recipe calls for grenadine, and you call for pomegranate molasses. I think the grenadine would've made this waay too sweet, so the molasses sounds like a good idea. It had a weird funk to it though. I wonder if Pama or just POM would've been a better compromise.

‚òòÔ∏èThe Clover Club. ‚ô£Ô∏è

In it's heyday the Clover Club was the preferred drink of pre-Prohibition gentlemen. It emerged from a Philadelphia men's group called (you guessed it) the Clover Club that met regularly at the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel from the 1880's to the 1920‚Äôs.  

Recipe- 

1.5 oz gin
3/4 oz fresh lemon juice
3/4 oz raspberry syrup (see recipe below)
1 fresh egg white

To make a Clover Club- 
Combine all ingredients in a shaker and dry shake for at least 10 seconds (shake it without adding ice).  Dry-shaking cocktails containing egg whites gives you more shaking time to build froth without over-diluting your cocktail. And part of the joy of the Clover Club cocktail is that beautiful, foamy top.
Add ice, shake to chill and dilute
Strain into a chilled cocktail glass (for this recipe, skip the double-straining to keep more of that fluffy foam).
Traditionally the Clover Club does not have a garnish.   I saved a couple raspberries for mine.  

Raspberry Syrup Recipe 

Combine 
1 cup of sugar 
1 cup of water
1 pint of fresh raspberries.  

Bring to a boil.   Turn off heat and let steep for 20 minutes.   Pour through a fine mesh strainer.   Using a spatula to press out all the juice.   Cool and refrigerate.  Will keep for up to a week.",1585571130

https://youtu.be/DLk67oMq8Og

He talks about the origin, different spirits used, muddled fruit as you said, different sugars used and so on.",1585548643
129,cocktails,"It‚Äôs not mentioned in 1806.

The 1806 definition of a cocktail that everyone talks about is ‚Äúspirits of any kind, sugar, water, and bitters‚Äù. Nobody was calling that an old-fashioned at the time for obvious reasons‚Äîbecause it was a new and fascinating thing. (The reason we have a definition from 1806 is because a letter-writer sent a question to their local newspaper to ask them what this new-fangled ‚Äúcocktail‚Äù business was all about.)

You only really start to see references to an ‚Äúold-fashioned‚Äù whiskey cocktail in the 1880s, after the development of various ‚Äúimproved‚Äù whiskey cocktails (with dashes of maraschino, cura√ßao, absinthe, etc.). Ordering an ‚Äúold-fashioned‚Äù cocktail was a way of saying ‚ÄúI just want whiskey, sugar, water (from ice) and bitters, hold the dashes and splashes of the other crap.‚Äù Later on that morphed into a standard cocktail order known as an Old-Fashioned. Even later still that cocktail turned into the muddled fruit abomination that people like to argue over.

The important thing to note is that the current standard Old-Fashioned (no fruit, just whiskey, sugar and bitters stirred down and strained over a big ice cube, garnished with a twist) isn‚Äôt a return to the original cocktail as defined in 1806, but a return to the standard of the 1880s. In 1806 you couldn‚Äôt always have access to ice to provide chill and dilution unless you lived near a cold place with a freshwater lake, so the drink was often served with plain water instead, and the drink was usually served up.

If you want the straight dope on the subject, read Robert Simonson‚Äôs book, *The Old-Fashioned*, or David Wondrich‚Äôs *Imbibe!*. Most articles about the subject online are, frankly, full of shit.",1585548525

134,cocktails,"One of my favorite drinks is the [Hanky Panky](https://punchdrink.com/recipes/hanky-panky/). Normally, I follow a standard recipe:

1.5 ounces London dry gin
1.5 ounces Carpano Antica Formula
1 bar spoon of Fernet-Branca

Tonight I made a variation:

1.5 ounces [Three Sisters Gin](http://cascadestreetdistillery.com/spirits/south-sister-gin/)
1.5 ounces [Pasubio](https://alpenz.com/product-pasubio.html)
1 bar spoon of Fernet-Branca
1 bar spoon of [Elisir Novasalus](https://alpenz.com/product-novasalus.html)

The result was a noticeably drier cocktail than the standard Hanky Panky. Pasubio's blueberry notes came forward, and the piney, resinous flavor of Elisir Novasalus was noticeable alongside Fernet-Branca's menthol note.

When I try this again, I'll do it with a more juniper-forward London dry gin. Three Sisters Gin is dominated by a sweet orange note, which I don't think holds up well against the bold flavors of the other ingredients. I thought I'd try it in this drink because I hoped that some of its more unique botanicals, like ponderosa pine pods, would play better than they did with the piney notes in both Pasubio and Elisir Novasalus.",1585547735

15 oz Twisted Path Distillery Madagascar Coco Nib Liqueur

10 oz Heavy Cream

10 oz Whole Milk

3 dashes of Bitterman‚Äôs Xocalatl Mole Bitters

Pour all ingredients into liter ISI Whipper. Chill in freezer for one hour. Charge the ISI Whipper with a single N2O charger, shake vigorously for 10 seconds. Dispense cocktail into glass and reserve ISI Whipper in freezer. Garnish with grated nutmeg and a maraschino cherry.

I love milkshakes, and I love cocktails, but I really hate boozy milkshakes. They are often times too heavy, rich, and thick for me to finish. From a service perspective, they are also impractical - there really is no way to produce them quickly, which costs bartenders money when serving a busy bar. Nitrogenating the milkshake in an ISI whipper solves all of these problems. Once nitrogenated, the body of the cocktail is significantly improved; it‚Äôs now a much lighter, easier drinking milkshake. The use of the ISI whipper also speeds up the speed of service - a full liter of cocktails can be batched at once, saving the bartenders time. This is really the only way I would consider using making boozy milkshakes, at home or at a bar.

We are living in some pretty unprecedented times so it is more important than ever to shine a light on the things that make you happy. Luckily for me I happened upon another cocktail to add to my favorites list recently - the ""Terrible Love"", created by the very talented Phil Ward of Death &amp; Co. and featured in the book of that name.

1.5oz Del Maguey Chicicapa Mezcal  
.75oz Suze  
.5oz St. Germain  
1 dash ""House Orange Bitters"" (equal parts Fee's &amp; Regan's #6)  
Grapefruit Twist

This drink immediately took me back to trying another Death &amp; Co. drink feaured in the book and created by Joaquin SImo - the Kingston Negroni. Not in flavor, but rather in the magical complexity and long lasting evolution of the drink. Both drinks feature big, bold flavors working together in harmony, both showcasing their own flavors and simultaneously working in symphony. With each sip you can wait a good 10-15 seconds or more as the flavors on your tongue continue to sing and open up.

A bit of citrus up front with a bitter midpalate from the Suze, which is a gentian root liqueur and also offers up the bright yellow appearance. Smoke and bitter gentian linger on the palate. A very mellow finish at first that intensifies. Subtle notes of St. Germain in the finish that get stronger as the drink evolves. Each sip really sort of differs ever so slightly from the last, allowing you the pleasure of exploring the flavors with each one. This drink also supports my love for grapefruit twists in cocktails. It works so well in conjunction with bitter flavors while also supporting citrus elements. It also plays nicely on the nose.

I so appreciate an incredible and beautifully complex cocktail. And this is one of the best I've ever had.",1585523645

370,cocktails,"The white/cloudiness is mostly small bubbles of air that was previously dissolved in the water when it was a liquid. Residential ice makers form the top down. The top layer of water freezes and slowly the ice grows downwards into the mold. This trap the air that was previously dissolved into the water.

Commercial ice makers form ice from the bottom up, this lets the gas escape. Additionally they may use water that was additionally filtered through a carbon tank to remove off flavors, water softener to reduce calcium and other minerals, or reverse osmosis to make it ""pure"" water.

Boil and cool the water before freezing it, and you'll get almost clear ice.",1585520003

-	0.8 oz aged Jamaican pot still rum ‚†Ä
-	1 oz Campari ‚†Ä
-	1.2 oz sweet vermouth (Dolin)‚†Ä
‚†Ä
A variant of the Negroni, the Kingston Negroni gets its name from the Capitol of Jamaica and its hogo from aged Jamaican pot still rum. In this bitter sipper, the herbal and citrusy Campari compliments the dank over-ripe tropical fruit notes of the rum and is accented by the characteristically orange-scented D-limonene terpene in the oil expressed into the glass via the orange peel. The vermouth completes the picture by providing tannins, body and depth. Note: Joaqu√≠n Sim√≥ does equal parts and uses Carpano Antica but I don‚Äôt have that and it‚Äôs not vegan. I bumped up the vermouth and bumped down the rum to help attain a more classic Negroni abv.  ‚†Ä
‚†Ä
Fun fact: While D-limonene smells like orange and is the primary terpene in orange peel oil, it has a mirror image is L-limonene, which is the primary terpene in the oil of lemon peels and is what makes lemons smell lemony.",1585512844

.75 oz Lemon Juice

.75 oz Rosemary Syrup

Dash of Orange Bitters

Top with 2 oz Club Soda

Rosemary Sprig for garnish

&amp;#x200B;

Shake all ingredients other than the Club Soda with ice, pour over ice in either a Rocks glass or more appropriately a Highball glass, top with Club Soda, add a sprig of Rosemary.

&amp;#x200B;

The idea for this drink came from Sylvain in New Orleans, they have a cocktail called the Rat Race which uses Sloe Gin and Lime instead (slightly different ratios as well). The original is terrific though I much prefer my above version.

&amp;#x200B;

The Rosemary Syrup is made using a 50/50 ratio of water/Demerara sugar with 4-6 sprigs of Rosemary . Bring heat to just below a boil for about two minutes while stirring so the sugar dissolves fully. Let sit for about 30 minutes before bottling. I usually use some sort of citrus in there too for a little added tang, I used Blood Orange in my last batch but this is in no way necessary.

P.S.: When all this is over, if you're ever at Dave Arnold and Don Lee's new bar Existing Conditions, try the Remedy -- it's basically Don Lee's updated version of the Shark.

New Zealand went into a COVID-19 lockdown this week, so I decided it was time to recreate a drink from the biggest proponents of #stayinside in the history of mankind: the citizens of the Novosibirsk Metro, frantically panic-buying every last vial of Green Stuff they can find.

Think coronavirus is bad? Try nuclear fallout. Beyond the sealed doors and locked gates of Metro, it‚Äôs nothing but a frozen wasteland for miles around, filled with mutants and demons and strange phenomena - and that‚Äôs without even mentioning the radiation that sets every geiger counter crackling. And there‚Äôs still no spare toilet paper.

Every adventurer exiting the Metro needs three things: a hazmat suit, a brass set of balls and, in the case of Novosibirsk survivors, as much Radioprotector AKA ‚ÄòGreen Stuff‚Äô they can carry.

**Recipe**

* 1oz (30ml) vodka
* 1.5oz (45ml) Midori
* .50oz (15ml) lemon juice
* Tbsp pastis

Add the pastis to your vessel and swirl it around as a rinse. Discard the majority. Add your vodka, Midori and lemon juice to a shaker filled with ice and shake thoroughly. Strain into your vessel. Garnish with a syringe and a lemon wheel. Serve!

**Tasting notes:** A Midori sour with a heavy sweetness tempered by the slight twinge of anise from the pastis.

**Best paired with:** Blind One steak - good luck getting it though.

3/4 oz Habanero Honey Syrup

3/4 oz Lemon juice

Shake with ice, pour into a coupe glass.



The Habanero Honey Syrup I make with 50/50 water and Bushwick Kitchen Habanero Honey boiled together for about 2 minutes. I've tried doing the honey/habanero infusion myself and the Bushwick Kitchen one is just as good so I went back to using that.

Brooklyn gin is a pretty good new school gin. I think it's close to Hendricks, in that it has a more cucumber/lemon/floral profile. Dolin Blanc is something I usually just sip straight over a single ice cube. 

I wanted an aviation, but didn't have Maraschino liqueur. I decided I wanted to show off the floral notes of the gin paired with the Violette, as well as showcase the vermouth. I usually prefer my Martinis heavy on vermouth (2 to 1 usually) but decided to go equal parts on this.

As far as the taste, I think it needs some acid to balance the sweetness, but just a tiny bit. It's got a clean and vibrant floral nose. The gin comes out quite strong at first, then the vermouth and Violette take over. There's a sweetness that creeps up, but it's not overpowering.

261,cocktails,"So I was bartending for a surprise engagement party and as I was finishing setting up the bar I got a request for something with tequila. I asked if she had any other flavors she liked, to which she replied, spicy and maybe smoky. With a limited selection of booze at this lake house, I planned to get by making simple three ingredient cocktails and random kitchen ingredients.

Well, right in front of me there appeared a bottle of sriracha and some crushed red peppers. I was already thinking about making a tequila sour anyway but in the spur of the moment I reached over and shook some peppers in the tin and squirted a quarter ounce of sriracha. When the drink came out of the shaker, you could just smell the spice in the air. She takes a sip and says it's really good, and proceeds to go pass the drink around and all of a sudden I'm slammed. After churning these out, I finally get to taste it myself. Something about the sriracha helped incorporate it well into this drink. I have a sneaking suspicion that it is the salt.

Anyway, I arrive home after that weekend and ordered a bag of dried hibiscus petals, inspired by her comment that Malaysians would like this drink. Apart from adding this puckering element that makes you salivate without too much added tartness, the hibiscus syrup also gives the drink an incredibly beautiful color. I also find that it works in a cosmo if you don't have cranberry juice, just use 1/4 ounce to help with the dryness. After some tinkering, here are the new specs for this drink without sriracha, because I don't have it at home and I can't go outside.

In concept, it's a great combination of flavours, but I think the cocktail could be improved by tweaking the proportions.

Reducing the amount of lemon might call for reducing sweetness as well, so it could turn out that the Gin and Chartreuse (and possibly Bitters) need to come up in volume.

I'd really recommend getting an app for your phone. It has been extremely helpful for me. I use My Cocktail Bar personally but I know quite a few people like Mixel. It allows me to build a shelf of ingredients and tells me what drinks I can make with those ingredients. There's a shopping list function so I can bookmark things I need. If a drink isn't listed, I can create both the drink and any ingredients needed that the app doesn't contain. I would also take the included recipes with a grain of salt to be safe.

2: If he‚Äôs that worried about ‚Äúproper dilution‚Äù why isn‚Äôt he serving this cocktail up instead of on a rock? The ice cube he is using contains a set amount of water, and it is going to melt eventually. If he IS that worried about ice melt, he should be chilling with a different set of ice, not with the cube that the guest will be using.

This simply shows how much you don't understand your spirits history.  Maraschinos varied greatly historically, as they do today.  The best of them were literally the sipping liqueurs of kings in the late 1700s.  Would you sip Luxardo's version?  Maraska's is much closer to the ""royal sipping version"".

Anyway, what are you talking about? PF is made by blending curacao orange distillate with aged brandy, it's stated in company's website. We have absolutelly no evidance that such procces was used to make Curacao back then. Yes, it could be made with ""flavorful, funky and/or spicy base spirit"" but by distilling such spirit with orange peels, not by blending it with aged spirit, not by aging anything at all.

It's like gin and genever, which is also a dutch invention as Curacao is. In his book Wondrich recommended substitute gin blended with aged irish whisky and sugar for real genever. Simular situation with PF Curacao where blending with aged spirit is also used. 

As for Thomas, there are two more recipes for Curacao liqueur, one with maceration only and another with maceration and distillation. In both cases 95% spirit was used. Thomas recipe ypu are talking about seems to be substitute that uses the most accessible spirit of that time.

Also no, we actually can make an assumption that Curacao was unified in some way, because in all cocktail books it is listed just as ""Curacao liqueur"", which means it was enought for contemporaries to understand what exactly it was. Like maraschino liqueur.

484,cocktails,"In quarantine, I realized that I was missing coke. In an effort to try not to drink all my calories while in isolation, I've avoided buying any sodas during my frenzied supermarket raids. Well after breakfast this morning, I'd had about enough. I need coke (the brown liquid kind).

I knew that coke built flavors in laters of bitter aromatics and spices (ginger, allspice, clove), tart citrus, and sweeteners. I have access to all of those flavors in my current pantry.

2oz Fernet Jel√≠nek
3 dashes Angostura bitters
A squeeze (0.25 oz?) of lemon
2-3 oz Topo Chico to top

The fernet is a Czech variety of the fernet amari, with very prominent allspice and clove notes and very sweet, with Ango filling in the more bitter spice profile. A squeeze of lemon balances it into place, while adding lime and orange would be a good touch too. Topping off with Topo seemed right, as the bubbles are medium/large which is about what canned coke has. If this isn't sweet enough, add a few mLs of simple and you've got a good approximation of an elevated adult coke.",1585411419

4,cocktails,"This one is super weird but strangely good.  Taking the first sip was a bit of a leap of faith, but each sip following that came easier and easier.   

Had to make some substitutions due to availability, but here is the recipe as in the book:

~~~~
*****

1.5 oz Eagle Rare Bourbon Whiskey
1 oz St. George Spiced Pear Liquer
0.25 oz caramelized onion syrup
0.75 oz lemon juice
0.75 oz egg white
0.5 oz simple syrup
1 orange peel

Dry shaken to froth the egg white and then shaken with ice and strained into a glass over two madeira ice cubes.

Caramelized onion syrup is made by caramelizing three large yellow onions on low heat for about 3 hours, then combining in a vacuum bag and cooking sous vide at 95 degrees C for 2 hours along with 1.5g kosher salt and 215g simple syrup.  The result is then strained through a chinois and reserved as caramalized onion syrup

The ice cubes aren't easily visible in the picture, but they're made of 190g Madeira, 170g water, and 5g sugar. 
 (It's specifically supposed to be Blandy's Rainwater Madeira, but I only had one option available among stores that aren't shut down in the pandemic, so I went with that).",1585409767
5,cocktails,It tastes like beautiful exquisite dirt. Honestly in my top 5 botanical liquors,1585409737
6,cocktails,"The New York Sour is a pretty famous drink for one that's a variation on an even more popular drink, the Whiskey Sour. The big difference is that this one has a float of red wine on the top. So, it's the best of both worlds, the spicy, caramelly rye whiskey with lemon, simple syrup and the lush, jammy, fruity bite of red wine on top. Plus, it looks really impressive, which is never a bad thing.

The Sour is a rudimentary drink category that's basically a spirit (brandy, rum, whiskey, gin, etc.), a citrus and a sweetener. The Sour, particularly the Whiskey Sour, was a staple of American life from the 1860's to the 1960's. So, it's not too much of a surprise that when cocktail books started popping up in the late 1800's, they had several flourishes and variations on this template. There were sours with Cura√ßao, egg white, benedictine, Jamaican rum floats and, of course, claret (red wine) floats.

There were so many Whiskey Sours with a red wine float popping up in books with so many different names, that it seemed like it was just part of the zeitgeist. However, David Wondrich, in his book, *Imbibe*, traced the drink's origin back to the Windy City. It made a few appearances in the Chicago Tribune in the early 1880's, including one bartender who claimed that the claret float originated at his bar. However, this barman just referred to the drink simply as a ""whisky sour"". 

The eventual name of New York Sour, didn't solidify until after Prohibition. In the 50 years in between the drink went by many names, such as, Brunswick, Saratoga, Touraine Sour (this one also had a dash of Benedictine), Continental Sour and Southern Whiskey Sour. It took the brain drain of bartenders fleeing the US for a decade during Prohibition and the popularity *Old Mister Boston's Bartender's Guide* from 1935 to marshal the culture behind the name, New York Sour, but it eventually stuck.

Then this drink, along with most others, faded into a memoryhole from the 1970's through the late 1990's as the world entered the Cocktail Dark Ages. However, when the Cocktail Renaissance kicked off in the late-2000's, this was one that was championed early by Julie Reiner, in particular. Reiner was a disciple of Dale Degroff and the owner of the New York mainstays, Flatiron Lounge, Pegu Club and Clover Club.

The lemon and the simple syrup (1:1) are really straightforward. The whiskey all the classic recipes called for was that resurrected classic, rye whiskey. Bourbon or Tennessee whiskey will do in a pinch, or even a grain-heavy blended Scotch if that's what you have on hand, but rye is what you want to use if you can. It gives it a really spicy, bready body to the drink that just works so well with the wine.

For the wine, pretty much any fruity, chewy red will do. Claret is what all the old bar books would call for, but that was just a catch-all term that bartender's from the 1800's used for any red wine. Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz, or my favorite, Malbec, are all good choices here.

The float itself it pretty easy. Just steadily pour it over the back of a spoon. A speed pourer is really helpful for this. But you could also use a measuring cup with a little spout to give your a better pour. This drink is one of those rare unicorns that is easy to make, looks amazing and tastes even better. Enjoy!

**Recipe:**

* 2 oz (60 ml) Rye Whiskey
* 0.75 oz (22 ml) Lemon Juice
* 0.75 oz (22 ml) Simple Syrup
* float 1 oz (30 ml) Red Wine

*Shake all but wine with ice. Double strain over large ice in an old fashioned glass. Float red wine on top.*",1585409671

192,cocktails,"You obviously don't want to learn or aren't paying attention.  You don't even know **your own** source material.  PF's process matches exactly that which Andrew Willett describes as occurring around the turn of the 19th century with geist distillation.   Mandarine Napol√©on has been using a similar process since the late 1700s, only with mandarin peel.  Willett simply doesn't name the base spirit, because he has no documentation to prove one way or another.

The point of Thomas' recipe is to replicate as closely as possible the flavor profile of the then available Cura√ßaos from Europe.  He does this so readers can obtain similar results to his.  He wrote a bartender's **guide** after all.  The rye would have provided a ""spiciness"" to the liqueur.  That recipe looks far more like PF Dry Cura√ßao than Cointreau or any other triple sec.

You want ""facts"" where very little exist.  There was no uniform process.  Each producer did it their own way, using their own ingredients, based on preference, quality, availability and cost.  All we can make is educated guesses.  However, your premise doesn't even come close to the facts we **do** have.

Prior to approximately 1860, Cura√ßaos **had** to be made with a flavorful, funky and/or spicy base spirit.  It **had** to be until the Coffey Still was in general use.  Cura√ßaos were certainly not all the same, just as today's orange liqueurs are not all the same.  The **only** conclusions we can reasonably make is that the original Cura√ßaos were far closer to PF Dry Curacao than Cointreau.  It's the only position that **can** be backed up with what facts we do have.  Besides, that fact you disagree with all the recognized ""experts"" in the industry is simply baffling.

I suggest you go back and study the links in our exchanges, including those you provided and don't seem to grasp.  You may learn something.  Combine the knowledge, with general spirits history, filter it through your critical thinking apparatus and come to an educated guess that fits the available facts.

Giger liqueur is home made. I took about 200 grams of ginger (possibly more, I didn't measure) and sliced it thin. I infused that in about 500ml of Everclear 60% and one star anise pod.

GM is not the only liqueur that is blended with brandy. From PF website:

""it is a traditional French ‚Äútriple sec‚Äù ‚Äì thee separate distillations of spices and the ‚Äúsec‚Äù or bitter, peels of Curacao oranges blended with brandy and Ferrand Cognac""

Jerry Thomas didn't meant this recipe to be real Curacao, it's just his imitation of it in case you have no acces to real Curacao. It's even called English Curacao.

Cate and Berry are cool guys when it's about rum (not always but mostly), I'm sure they naven't done any researche about Curacao, they never claimed they have. Didn't know about Trader Vic, where does he agree that Curacao is brandy based or something like this?

Cafe Royal Cocktail Book. Great book. Among other things it says that tequila is made from cactus. But nevermind, it's just not as you said. Yes, it set  Cointreau aside from Curacao because it's famouse brand same as it does with Aurum. What even more important, the book claims that Triple Sec is discription of white Curacao, basically the same thing.

As for articles, no offence to them but it's just articles without any sources, it doesn't matter how many of them are there. These are not an argument at all.

Again, I'd really be happy to see some soucres that proofs that Curacao liqueur from mid 19-20 centry is distilled curacao spirit blended with brandy or that it's just a macerated spirit.

If you want a clear product, I would start with 2X the strength of the final product, e.g. if you want the liqueur to be at 30%, infuse at 60% and then dilute 1:1 by volume with sugar syrup.

385,cocktails,"Dave wrote about orange liqueurs long before he started the project with Pierre Ferrand.  In fact, it was his writing that afforded him the invitation to participate.

Understand that GM is the only brand that ""mixes with brandy"".  The **only** spirit in most Cura√ßaos is some kind of brandy.  The process is either a maceration of the dried peels in brandy or an actual distillation, [geist](https://www.elementalmixology.com/liquors/geist-spirits.html) or otherwise.  Some were clarified, other were not.  Watch the Pierre Ferrand video i linked earlier.

Please, don't misunderstand me.  This discussion is not black &amp; white.  There is, however, a clear distinction, starting in the later 19th century, between clean, crisp triple secs (Cointreau/Combier) and warm, often spicy cura√ßaos (Bols/Marie Brizard).  The later being the only known general style prior to the availability of the continuous still in the 1850s/60s.  Need we mention all the other orange liqueurs introduced in the late 18th/early 19th centuries, especially from France and Spain, most of them brandy-based like Mandarine Napol√©on.  Not all ""historic"" orange liqueurs fit neatly into strict categories.  And modern examples tend to do whatever they please.  
\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We know what Jerry Thomas meant by Cura√ßao.  He included a recipe for it in his Bartender's Guide:

Take 6 ounces of very thin orange peel.

1 pint of whiskey.

1 pint of clarified syrup.

1 drachm powdered alum.

1 drachm carbonate of potash.

Place the orange peel in a bottle, which will contain a quart, with the whiskey ; cork tightly and let the contents remain for ten or twelve days, shaking the bottle frequently. Then strain out the peel, add the syrup ; shake well, and let it stand for three days. Take out a tea-cupful into a mortar, and beat up with the alum and potash ; when well mixed, pour it back into the bottle, and let it remain for a week. The Cura√ßoa will then be perfectly clear and equal in flavor to the best imported article.  
\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We know that Martin Cate specifically calls for PF Dry Cura√ßao when he wants Cura√ßao.  Trader Vic &amp; Jeff Berry also spec similarly.  
\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can look to historical cocktail books that clearly define Cointreau/triple secs differently from Cura√ßao  [1937 Cafe Royal Cocktail Book - EUVS](https://euvs-vintage-cocktail-books.cld.bz/1937-Cafe-Royal-Cocktail-Book-Coronation-Edition/254)

Yes, I don't actually know what was meant for Curacao back in 17th century, it surely could be spirit macerated with oranges. I'm talking more about actually cocktail books and there were not many of these before 1850s.

Seems we have some kind of missunderstanding about spirit. Yes, I assume that Curacao liqueurs back then wasn't a neutral spirit based as it's in modern Tripple Secs. Maybe its base spirit even can be called  eau de vie today, but it was a base where orange peels were macerated then distilled. We have [some proofs of such procces](https://elementalmixology.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/cl0031.jpg) and that fact that almost in all cocktail books of that time there are planty of mentions of white (read colorless) curacao.

But personally I didn't find any sources that claims spirit distilled with Curacao oranges was mixed with brandy (as it's in GM and PF Curacao) and resulted liqueur was called Curacao. If I'm wrong I would be willing to look at these sources. And I didn't hear anything about aging Curacao spirit bofore. Can I have a source or just mentioning it where I can read about it?

In general: The above ordering, left-to-right was in order of most sweet to less. The Picon Biere bottle is low, and may be a bit oxidized, but the flavor was consistent with previous (sober) stand-alone tastings--Not really that good. It's probably best used as intended: as an enhancement to a simple pint of pilsner. By itself it's too sweet and one dimensional. The ""Club"" bottling is better, but the Amer bottle is the best of the bunch and surprisingly close to the Amer Boudreaux that I just mixed up. (7.5 oz Ramazzotti, 6 oz orange tincture, 1 oz Stirrings Orange Bitters, 2.5oz water).

We all liked the Boudreaux better than the Biere or the Club, but it was a toss up on the freshly opened bottle of Amer Picon.

I've tasted the ""original"" Amer Boudreaux neat at Canon in the past year, and I found it matched my recollection of the version I'd made with the ratios above.

My other Picon sub is Amer Cio Ciarro (sp?) which is really close but it has some balsam/piney notes to it that I don't find offensive but mark it as different than the Picons.",1585272060

156,cocktails,"First of all, let me say that there are few topics in the spirits world that create as heated of debates as this one.  That being said...

I love Andy's work.  He also seems like a nice guy.  Met him at Tales...  I give him great kudos for his research on French Cura√ßaos and Triple Secs.  Where he seems to go astray is his willful ignorance toward the original Curacao, what the French call *Cura√ßao d‚ÄôHollande.*  Andy credits Dutch Cura√ßao as being introduced shortly after 1800.  This we know is far off, as Bols first produced their Cura√ßao Liqueur in the late 17th century, well over 100 years earlier.

Bols historians claim that their Cura√ßao would have had a base liquor of either grape eau de vie, molasses-based rum or grain-based alcohol, depending on when the Cura√ßao was made and the target quality of the finished liqueur.  Their best guess is that the original Cura√ßao would have simply been Laraha peels (and perhaps other spices), macerated in eau de vie, aged in oak, cut with water to proof and sweetened with sugar.  Somewhere around 1800, at least some Dutch producers moved to a geist distillation, similar to their process for Genever, and perhaps a grain-based spirit.  This more ""refined"" spirit is most likely what truly caught the French's attention.

The French loved *Cura√ßao d‚ÄôHollande* and started honing it to their own tastes.  It is first mentioned that spirit from the NW of France was used as a base.  This has been interpreted as eau de vie.  Grape and apple spirits were by far the most predominant of the time.  The French also used a multi-distillation process to produce ""*French Cura√ßao""* before it was placed in barrels for aging.

David Wondrich in *Imbibe!* states, ""This orange-flavored liqueur was one of the essentials of the bar. Early versions were based on young brandies or rums, rather than the neutral spirits used today. For me, the best substitute is therefore the cognac-based Grand Marnier...""  He and  Alexandre Gabriel conducted much historical research.  Pierre Ferrand's Dry Curacao is the product of their research, claiming to be a ""traditional French triple sec.""

Then came the invention off the Coffey Still, patented in 1830 but not in general use until the 1850s.  Cointreau is credited as producing the first triple sec in 1875.  This style of orange liqueur was only made possible by neutral grain spirits, which didn't arrive until the Coffey Still made them possible.

Ultimately, written records prior to 1800 are sporadic at best.  We can only make educated guesses as to the earliest forms of Cura√ßao.  In my head, I tend to categorize Cura√ßaos as having ""age"" and a base spirit that adds to the final flavor profile of the liqueur and triple secs as only using neutral grain spirits and remaining young.

By the time Trader Vic put the Mai Tai on his menu in 1944, we had long had neutral grain spirits and triple secs.  So, if you see Jerry Thomas or Trader Vic refer to a Cura√ßao in their recipes, they are most certainly not referring to a neutral based triple sec, but an aged Cura√ßao.

**Anticuada Oaxaque√±o**

*Recipe By:* Steve Cutchen

*Summary:* 

Something or someone of Oaxaca, the home of mezcal, is called Oaxaque√±o (wa-ha-KANE-yo). So something Old Fashioned from Oaxaca, a mezcal and tequila version of the venerable cocktail, is an Anticuada Oaxaque√±o. 

Tequila‚Äîreposado because, like a good whiskey, it brings deeper, more complex flavors‚Äîis there to balance the mezcal. I tried an A√±ejo, and it kinda got lost.  I like the bite of the reposado.

Cura√ßao provides the sweetness and a citrus note to the agave spirits.

I was amazed at the contribution of the single dash of chocolate bitters. Kind of an Aztec thingee? One dash is plenty.

*Ingredients:*

* 1 ounce tequila, (recommended: El Tesoro reposado)
* 1 ounce mezcal, (recommended: Del Maguey Vida)
* 1/2 ounce Cura√ßao
* 1 dash chocolate bitters, (recommended: Pitch Dark Cacao Bitters)

*Directions:*

Add all the ingredients to a chilled mixing glass and fill with ice. Stir 35 rounds and strain into an Old Fashioned glass with fresh ice.",1585256267

Overall, I'm pretty happy. My one complaint is that the foam is notably not very dense, but that only makes sense when you compare 1+ ounce of egg white to a couple mL of this stuff.

Day 7 of Quarantine
.
Daydreaming about adventures and thinking about our trip to Spain.
.
About an hour outside of Barcelona, on the side of a small mountain range about 4,000ft up, is a small monastery called Montserrat. It's an absolutely beautiful place full of history and I highly recommend anyone who travels to the area visit it.
.
The story of Montserrat goes that one day two hikers were in the mountain and came across a cave that housed a statue called the Black Madonna. It's Mother Mary &amp; baby Jesus but their skin is painted black. No one knows where it came from, therefore: miracle. The people in the town below began hiking up the mountain to pray to this statue. The bishop didn't like that too much so one night he climbed up the mountain to steal the statue. As he's climbing down the mountain, the statue became heavier and heavier until he couldn't carry it any further. Second miracle. So, he built the monastery around it.
.
Anyways, these monks up in the mountain make booze, so my first stop was to try everything. One of their liqueurs, Aromas de Montserrat, is made with 12 herbs from the mountain and made the same way for the last 200-300 years. It tastes like a toned down Green Chartreuse, very delicious.
.
Long story short, I made a cocktail based off of the Last Word.

305,cocktails,"m+h popularized ginger and honey syrups. They went 3:1. I've never had a 1:1 honey syrup that I've thought was not too thin. I've gone either 2:1 or 3:1. Yes smugglers cove is an iconic place. Top notch. But just because they go 1:1, does not make that the standard but would put them in the minority for ""craft"" cocktail establishments. 

I'd argue Paul McGee of Lost Lake would be the domestic authority on tiki, if you had to choose. He is 2:1 on honey. https://www.tastingtable.com/cook/recipes/Three-Dots-and-a-Dash-Cocktail-Recipe

Going back to 1:1, yes, sure this can work. Because the conversation is ultimately one of water content. Right? So yeah, we could go 1:1 but what would specs look like? Would your gold rush, bees knees, etc be the same recipe on a 1:1 honey versus a 2:1 or 3:1? What kind of ice are you using to shake? Type of ice would have added importance here. You now have 2 water content variables: honey and ice.  Honey versus white sugar, which one has more water content in it? Simple syrup would be sugar to water 1:1. Honey syrup would be honey to water 1:1, does that make sense to you? Does honey have more water content than white sugar? If so, do you adjust for that or do you say, eh, somebody else does it that way, so they must be the ""authority?"" Not trying to be difficult.

Smelling that flavor of the orange/lemon peel (or whatever garnish you use) will influence your palate on what flavors are in the drink, as a large potion of our taste comes from what we smell.


Also, people like to ""drink"" with their eyes first. For most, if a drink ""looks"" good, it will taste better to them",1585244621

375,cocktails,"Well, 2:1 is often given as some ‚Äùstandard‚Äù ratio and I (along with a friend) started out with that and tried around until I found a recipe I prefer. 

I also own David A. Embury‚Äôs [*The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fine_Art_of_Mixing_Drinks), and have tried his recipe: he calls for 5:1. Now, Embury likes his drinks really dry and boozy (suggesting 8:2:1 for sours where I usually prefer 4:2:1, for instance, and 7:1 for a Dry Martini) so I wasn‚Äôt surprised that those proportions weren‚Äôt for me.

The Manhattan recipe isn‚Äôt really my problem here, I like it this way. But it‚Äôs very possible that trying to do a Rob Roy the same way won‚Äôt work. How would you do your Manhattan?",1585244294

Roast the bananas ahead of time, I did three for this quart, could probably take it up one or two. I just split them up lengthwise, coat with maybe a tablespoon or two of melted butter and sprinkle on brown sugar and cinnamon, you could also just skip the butter/sugar/cinnamon and add a little water to the pan.  Then roast it (I just fo 350 F) until it's all nice and brown and mushy and you can barely control the urge to eat it with a spool. Set aside to cool


-2 cups heavy cream

-1 cup milk

-anywhere from 2-6 large egg yolks depending on how custardy you want it (I tend to go 3-4)

-1/8 tsp salt

-2/3 cup brown sugar

-1/4 cup light corn syrup (if you don't have/want to use, just drop and do 3/4 c brown sugar instead)

Mix those into a saucepan (I like to mix the sugar and yolks together separately to ensure the yolk all incorporates) and bring it up on medium heat to about 160 F.  Don't let it get much hotter or your milk/eggs will start to curdle in the bottom of the pan.

Once you hit this temperature, and the custard coats the back of a spoon nicely (keeps a straight line if you drag your finger through), take it off the heat, add 1 tsp of vanilla and your banana mixture, and blend together (if you don't have a blender, mashing up the bananas and then mixing is fine).

Transfer to an ice bath to bring the temp down to about 40F, then store in the fridge overnight to age. Then standard churn and harden for a few hours.",1585243128

Or try making a tincture spray out of it. using vodka and weighing out the geosmine, let it rest for a few hours, strain it out and use it as an atomized aromatizer for a drink to spray your glass with.

If you do not have the substance, then my suggestion would be to get a lightly peated scotch such as famous grouse, or great king street artist blend, or maybe even dewars white label, hell johnny walker black if you want to go with a more well known name and a tad more pricy. Take some sencha green tea leaves- steep it for 4 hours. use one bottle  (1 liter) and about 50 grams of sencha green tea leaves. let it steep and to me, combining green tea and a smokey peaty scotch smells and taste almost like a lush rain forest where rain has just dropped onto the ground and makes for the absolute best penicillin in the world.

475,cocktails,"The dry shake emulsifies the egg white fully and incorporates it more evenly with the rest of the drink. The goal is to expand the egg white, similar to making whipped cream or meringue.

You can certainly forego a dry shake, but it does require a bit more work to incorporate the egg white and you run the risk of over dilution.

You‚Äôve done a good job, juding by the surface of your drink. 

You can tell an egg white isn‚Äôt fully incorporated if the surface is full of large, glossy bubbles. But don‚Äôt be discouraged if you have a few, the texture of the drink is what‚Äôs important.

If the drink looks loose and similar in viscosity to a non-egg white cocktail, it hasn‚Äôt been shaken enough.

A good egg white cocktail is delicate and full, almost creamy in texture, making egg whites ideal for dessert drinks.

One drink that best exemplifies what an egg white adds to a drink is the Ramos Gin Fizz, where egg white is combined with heavy cream and seltzer, creating a thick foam cap that stands on its own above the glass.

You can also substitute aquafaba for egg white to make vegan-alternatives to your favorite egg white cocktails!",1585237358

477,cocktails,"Im curious as to which brand he got as well. Rhum agricole is my perosnal favorite style of rhum. Earthy, less sweet, and has a vegetal note and smells almost like a pure form of ketchup ( my personal sense of smell).

As for how to use it. Try doing a split base to soften it up. A split base is just a mix of two spirits as a base for a cocktail . For example. 1 oz agricole rhum, 1 oz bourbon, 1 oz lemon juice .75 oz simlple syrup. Don't try that lol. bourbon and agricole rhum really do not mix and that's just an example.

What I would really try though is using sherry to help that taste. Using le'ts say 1.5 east india sherry, a lighter style of sherry, and .5 oz of that agricole rhum, .75 oz lime juice, .5 oz simple syrup (demerara). All ingredients shaken. Over ice.  Now that would taste good. Reason being- you have the dry raisin-ey stone like fruit complexity of the vermouth, the vegetal and earthy flavor of the rum and using far less of it but can still go a long way in a cocktail . The bright and freshness of the lime juice that tends to go much better with rum since it is more acidic, and the nice heavy richness from demerara syrup that blends well with rum as well. 

On that note, don't be afraid to make some sort of a grog (blending different style of rums together) for instance, ( White rum, Dark rum, your agricole rum) and use less agricole rum in the grog such as 1 oz  white,  .75 dark rum, .25 agricole rum.

BBQ Bird

2 oz blood orange infused mezcal justino

.5 oz Suze

.5 oz Ancho Reyes

1 oz lemon juice

.5 oz bbq sauce syrup

4 oz tepache

5 drops 25% saline

Shake, double strain into glass. Garnish with ridiculous pineapple frond. 

The mezcal has a healthy amount of smoke, fruit, and slight bitterness to it - there‚Äôs a strong mesquite flavor that immediately reminded me of bbq. I paired that with Ancho Reyes right away, and then add Suze for more bittering, earthy notes.

Pretty frequently, I‚Äôll add a small amount of blackstrap molasses to the Jungle Bird to balance it out - here, I initially attempted to do the same thing with straight bbq sauce.

Whiskey - I like to keep a smooth bourbon, like buffalo trace, a hotter bourbon, a blended scotch, a peaty scotch, an irish whiskey, a Maryland rye and a pennaylvania rye

Gin - to,cover the bases I keep,genever, old tom, london dry, Plymouth and then usually a few new american gins

Agave - an unaged, a repo, and a few mezcales is what i keep

Vodka - I dont,usually stock vodka. Russian standard is my,go,to

Cordials- definatley want a bitter apertif like Campari, probably want a maraschino, an orange liqueur, a fruity liquor, some aromatized wine like dry/sweet/blanc,vermouths, quinquinas and the like, a few amari or krauterlicors, something anise-y, and some bittera too. Ango and peychauds should,cover most things. Regans orange bitters are great too",1585227572
111,cocktails,"According to David A. Embury‚Äôs [*The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fine_Art_of_Mixing_Drinks) the answer is very simple: clarity. To make a cocktail really clear you need to stir it, and this aesthetic is desirable in some cocktails (and impossible to achieve in others). This leads is to some ground rules of thumb which each takes precedence over the preceeding one:

1. So the default method is to shake, because it‚Äôs the most efficient way of chilling a cocktail.

2. If you want a clear drink (examples: Dry Martini, Manhattan, Old Fashioned) you instead have to stir it.

3. Even if you‚Äôd like it clear, some drinks just never will be so there‚Äôs no reason not to shake them. Examples include anything with a significant amount of citrus juice, and especially any drink which combines citrus juice and vermouth as that combination always becomes muddy.

4. Finally, this is probably obvious, but never shake anything carbonated. You could shake every other ingredient first and stir in the carbonated ingredient last if you like.

These rules are of course not true rules, but suggestions, do as you like with your own cocktails! There may be exceptions. But they explain the reasoning. 

‚Äî

Finally I‚Äôll say that I personally don‚Äôt believe that dilution plays any meaningful role, and neither did Embury. If you mix *X* volume of spirits at room temperature with *Y* volume of ice at your freezer‚Äôs temperature, the result is an equilibrium at a certain temperature. That resulting temperature is theoretically going to be the same no matter how you mix it, as long as you keep stirring/shaking until the temperature reaches a steady state, and the dilution is always going to be the amount of ice melted in order to absorb the heat from the spirits which is the same. In practice there may be small things that make reality different from the model ‚Äî if it takes place during very different timescales, a really quick shake vs. a super-slow stir, the ambient temperature is going to play its part (leading to more dilution in the stirred drink). If you shake very hard it may lead to lots of tiny chips of ice floating in the shaken drink, which after they melt lead to more dilution in the shaken drink.

You could test this if you find really precise weighing scales. Make identical cocktails, stir one and shake the other, and weigh them (and take their temperature) as soon as they‚Äôre done to see if one of them has more water.",1585227534

121,cocktails,"Im sure theres a ton of different methods, but this is my personal:

Simple syrup I make at 1.5:1. I like to keep dilution down so this is a nice middleground between simple and rich simple. I measure water by volume and pure unbleached cane sugar by weight and heat gently until it dissolves making sure it doesnt boil. I hot bottle with a half ounce of vodka per 8oz of simple and place directly in the fridge. I make Demerara syrup the same way.

Honey syrup I just use my electric kettle to mix 185F water into 2x the amount of honey by volume. Honey is heavy for its volume so this seems to be more accurate for my purposes. I usually place the mixing vessel in a bowl of hot water to help with mixing.

Grenadine I just made a few weeks ago and it totally changed my view on it. Its so much better even if you use processed juice. I like this recipe: 8oz POM Wonderful juice, 8oz unbleached cane sugar, 1oz Pomegranate molasses, and 1/2 tsp orange flower water(optional). You make it the same way as my simple syrup above. I prefer not to boil any of these.",1585227014

‚Ä¢2oz Hendrick‚Äôs Midsummer Solstice Gin
‚Ä¢1.5oz LaCroix Pure Soda Water (a little extra here for a larger glass)
‚Ä¢0.75oz Heavy Cream
‚Ä¢0.75oz Simple Syrup (1:1 Ratio)
‚Ä¢3/8oz Fresh Lemon Juice
‚Ä¢3/8oz Fresh Lime Juice
‚Ä¢One Egg White
‚Ä¢2-4 Drops Fee Brothers Orange Flower Water

‚Ä¢Add all ingredients except for the soda water into a shaker tin, allow approximately ten seconds of no action for the citrus and alcohol to work upon the egg white, and then dry shake for 45-60 seconds. Add one large (tempered) ice cube and shake until the cube is completely dissolved. Pour approximately 1.5oz of cold soda water into a chilled Collins glass, then add the mixture from the shaker tin down into the middle, and up to the rim of the glass. Allow about two minutes to settle before adding the remaining contents from the tin into the glass to float and sit above the rim. Garnish with a couple drops of orange flower water, and put one straw downward through the middle of the cocktail.

The final result was much better than my anticipations, providing an all-encompassing balance as a refreshing, semi-sweet, citrusy, and floral cocktail with capability to be indulged upon for anywhere between breakfast and dessert.

235,cocktails,"Love this question and glad you are asking these questions. So first off, let me start by saying that I myself am 23. So you do not need crazy amounts of experience to be able to work at a top tier place.

I digress and will start by answering your first question. Carrying yourself is tricky and no one answer will be the same and that took the most time for me to understand. I started working behind a bar at 20 and just not feel like I have more confidence. But to point you in the right direction. Be yourself, And understand that if you are trying to give a guest a good experience, then you are already doing a fantastic job and people will feel that above all else. A good thing that helped me is knowledge. Like obviously knowing your menu in and out, both beverage and food, as those questions are going to be the most asked questions whether you like it or not. So that already gives you confidence to some degree to answer questions. Then start to learn the knowledge of tools of the trade such as spirits and where they are from and knowing how you all make your in house ingredients. So essentially being aware. And lastly, smile and have a great time. DO NOT ever looked stressed, even if you are a hundred drink tickets deep. forgot to ring something in or simply can't answer a question. Just take a deep breath, relax and know that you are in control of whatever experience your guest is going to receive. Be friendly, lively and professional.

As for your question on interviews. My best advice is to  know exactly where you want to work, or at least know the type of place you would like to work at. Research them, understand their core values and study their menu, the people that work/worked there and come prepared. For the place I am at now,  which is a really well regarded place in Manhattan, I actually went for an open call. BRING A RESUME, make sure that to the best of your ability that everything is on one page. You'd be surprised how many people do not bring resume's to even these high-end restaurant/bars just because they think it's a restaurant/ bar and have this ""Why do  I need it attitude"". Another thing is to be excited. Any employer is super lucky to have someone excited and enthused to be there. Whoever is interviewing you will see how stoked you are to be there and they will feed off that energy. With a lot of these high end places I will warn you that they want you to know your Sh\*t. So having a good base knowledge is a must. Like knowing the difference between Scotch and Bourbon. (Yes there are huge differences in laws). They will ask you though in seemingly backhanded ways though, to make sure that you do, in fact, know your sh\*t. Lastly I was fortunate enough to have an incredible mentor that opened some of the best bars in NYC and knew people in the industry. But I never mentioned him during an interview even with people that knew him.

&gt;  
&gt;Yet another common way that people often look past is straining pulp from juice as much as possible. 

This is great advice.  It's the combination I do. I'm a home mixologist, so keeping juices fresh a while is important... I have low volume usage. But still, I want to have juice to use, ready to go, without having to squeeze it every time.

I juice maybe a quart of lime or lemon juice at a time. I strain it through several iterations to remove as much pulp as possible, then freeze it in about 6 ounce portions in [1 cup plastic lidded Ball containers](https://www.amazon.com/Ball-Jar-8-Ounce-Plastic-Freezer/dp/B007BVFYO8/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1EHHN24XQN83X&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=ball+plastic+cups+with+lids&amp;qid=1585198774&amp;sprefix=ball+plastic+cups%2Caps%2C175&amp;sr=8-3&amp;swrs=572E306EFB14D896E2A9DD72FEDE049C). I thaw them in the fridge, and any remaining pulp tends to aglomerate and can be strained off. I keep the clear juice for use in a 1 [cup Oxo salad shaker containers](https://www.amazon.com/OXO-Little-Salad-Dressing-Shaker/dp/B00N4VIH0M/ref=sr_1_4?crid=2GA48XGM9264K&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=oxo+salad+dressing+shaker&amp;qid=1585198816&amp;sprefix=oxo+salad+dre%2Caps%2C184&amp;sr=8-4).

I know that from a purist/professional standpoint, my juice will be different than fresh squeezed. But I'm making drinks for me, and it's OK. The convenience is huge.  I'm playing with using a bit of vodka in the juice as a preservative, but I haven't determined if that is worthwhile.",1585199145

244,cocktails,"This is an excellent question, something that very few places do right. The ABSOLUTE best way to do this, is to have a large ice box or ice chest, fill it with pebble ice if you have a pebble ice maker, and use garnish holders to hold your herbs. How you store it in the garnish holders is important too. Best way to keep mint and other herbs fresh is by layering your chosen garnish with layers of damp towels. just pull off a little bit and wrap it around the stem of the garnish . If you have that large ice box then this is great. If not, then this next method is fantastic.

We actually used this at my first bar and to this day nothing has worked better. On amazon, you can buy these little tiny jars that look something out of a biology class. super cheap. the point is to by something that is small, shallow, and has a screw top to it and make sure that it is glass, not plastic, as plastic heats a lot faster. Fill the bottom of it with some ice. On top of the ice put that damp piece of towel over it and then put your herb/mint on top of that. That way the herbs aren't being drowned in the ice and are not losing it's flavor/ smell by being exposed to the ice too quickly. Only pain in the rear about this method is changing the ice every so often and that you can't store copious amounts of herbs in there at once. But this is a good thing so that the herbs can stay fresher for longer.",1585198622

251,cocktails,"Every juice has a different shelf life. Once exposed to oxygen it all goes south from there. But the easiest and best way to keep juice for a long time is actually grabbing a plastic container, and freezing it. We have done this at the restaurant I am at now and it lasts for literal weeks. Thawing is the trickiest part as it's important to not let it run under hot water as it will most likely dilute due to expansion of the container if you are using plastic and using water. So this method is great if you have a ton of citrus left over.

Another thing you can do to store and make your juice last longer is to get citric acid or malic acid (you can find at wal mart or spice or culinary dense store) and add just a few pinches to it, stir it up and it will actually keep better.

Yet another common way that people often look past is straining pulp from juice as much as possible. So investing in a fine strainer is ideal as the natural pulp from the skins of the fruit cause browning. So double straining and using a coffee filter can give your lime juice, lemon juice as much as an extra day or two. Lastly if you have time/space in your fridge, create your own ice chest. Store your juice in a glass container, lay it on top of the ice and it gives you quite the length of life of fresh juice than you'd expect. Hope this helps",1585197923

272,cocktails,"Hmm, you should try to get to know the flavor of the base spirits. See what you enjoy drinking.
But if you like rum, maybe go for Daiquiris? They can be a great standard to measure bars on.

Also, they are super easy to make even at home.
Get yourself a shaker tin (Boston, all metal), strainer, fine mesh strainer cause we are fancy, a nice coupe glass, citrus press, and a jigger. Check oxo for the jigger at least, great value for money.

Then buy yourself a good bottle of middle shelf rum, some limes and sugar. For the sugar go either with regular white sugar or Demerara. The latter provides more depth in drinks and should be used in combination with a darker rum.
Syrup is easily made by mixing 1:1 (regular sugar) or 2:1 (Demerara) sugar with water by volume on low heat on the stove. Keep stirring and never bring to a boil. Keeps for a few weeks in the fridge.

Specs are debatable, I however prefer the following:

* 2 oz dark rum
* 3/4 oz fresh lime juice
* 1/2 oz Demerara syrup (2:1) ... adjust to taste

If using regular 1:1 syrup, 3/4 oz should be fine.",1585191011

364,cocktails,"Recipe: 

1.5oz Castle &amp; Key Gin 

1.5oz Dolin Blanc Vermouth

1 tsp. Earl Grey Syrup

2 dashes Orange Bitters (I use Fee‚Äôs)

Lemon Twist

Method: 

Add all ingredients to a mixing glass. Stir quickly (you want to leave some heat on the cocktail, really stirring just enough to get the ingredients cold. Leaving your gin and vermouth in the refrigerator as well as keeping your mixing glass in the freezer before use help) and strain into chilled coup glass. Express lemon twist over drink.

Explanation: 

I‚Äôve always loved an equal parts gin martini, and prefer a blanc vermouth to a dry one. If it sounds too saccharine, using a navy strength or overproof gin in place of Castle &amp; Key here really shines, as it offsets the sweetness of the extra vermouth. 

I‚Äôve also been toying with adding a tsp. or so of syrups to stirred cocktails, generally looking for a syrup that lifts the flavor of the base liquors. The extra sugar also lends viscosity to a cocktail that could end up a bit thin ie. Equal parts martinis. I used earl grey in this one to compliment the chamomile and ginger notes in Castle &amp; Key but you can use any sort of tea or even leftover fresh herbs (basil and thyme come to mind as herbs that‚Äôd compliment this build, and something bright and green like cilantro or parsley could be cool to pair into a classic martini or Negroni, even).",1585179290

It's always super-watered down, and you just get sort of unsatisfying ""spiced beer"" flavor, with some random hot sauce or umami notes sticking out, like you said.

That's why I really like the way this one is served - there's only a few ounces of beer in the drink at first, so it's balanced more like a typical cocktail. The strongest note is the lime and seasoning, while the beer is almost playing the role of a club soda in a highball. You use up the rest of the beer as you drink it down, so you're getting the whole gradient effect, from savory cocktail down to flavored beer.

I took forever-and-a-half to add the Michelada to my cocktail app, because there are so many versions of the recipe that it's nearly impossible to pick the ""right"" one... but this version is really solid, and I think it's the use of a smaller initial measure of beer that makes it work!",1585168171

For the first week, I took inspiration from my favorite flavor chips, bacon habanero. Since this wasn't going to be sweet, I used a standard 750 bottle of vodka as the base. First, slice 5 fresh habaneros and added them to the vodka in a jar, minus the seeds/membrane. Leave at room temp for 2 days, shaking occasionally. Then, strain the infused vodka into a glass bowl and add 2 tbsp of melted bacon fat, whisk to combine. Seal the bowl and set in the fridge overnight. Spoon out the solids, then run the vodka through a coffee filter and funnel into the original bottle. When drunk straight, it's immediately spicy, but still retains the habanero flavor. Then it mellows out, leaving behind some nice, smoked bacon-y goodness.

I thought this would be best suited in a bloody mary. I work at a brunch restaurant, so I took it into work with me and made myself a drink; 2 oz of the infused vodka, house mary mix, topped with Tajin, olives, and green onion. Seriously, it was SO GOOD! I'm not a big fan of bloody marys in general, but it was absolutely delicious. Next level, for sure.

by Giuseppe Gonzalez‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£

* 1.5 oz Angostura Bitters‚Å£‚Å£

* 1 oz orgeat‚Å£‚Å£

* .75 oz lemon juice‚Å£‚Å£

* .5 oz rye whiskey‚Å£‚Å£


shake, strain into a Nick and Nora or coupe. ‚Å£‚Å£


This is a drink that people dont expect to be anywhere near as good as it is.  With so much bitters, it should be a lip-curling experience but surprisingly yields a sweet, nutty, spiced, and of course bitter twist on a whiskey sour. The orgeat adds almondy marzipan sweetness while creating a slightly fuller texture that with the help of a little acidity reigns in the bitters. The end result is a modern classic. ‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
I used Liber and Co Orgeat.  They're a great company out of Austin, TX where I used to bartend.  I also used Old Overholt rye.  It's an affordable classic rye and the oldest continuously distilled product in the states.

Working with cold ingredients is good because it lets you hit temperature before dilution, giving you more time when shaking or stirring.

41,cocktails,"The fundamental problem with mixing gin and carpano antica is that you lose so much of the delicate botanical flavors you get from gin, and really the only things that end up standing up to the carpano are juniper and some citrus. Rarely did I find any gin able to do that, unless I was getting near navy strength level such as plymouth navy strength. Clocks in at around 57% ABV so it hits hard. 

I like gin and sweet vermouth drinks, but usually use french vermouths for them, or cocchi if italian is called for. Martinez, hanky panky, gin&amp;it come to mind.

If I make a negroni and cut down the carpano antica to about half an ounce and keep everything else the same, you get an off-balanced drink that lacks depth, sweetness and ends up more bitter. That said, carpano is a fine choice in a boulevardier depending on what whiskey you use (rittenhouse for example), but I would still lean towards cocchi because it's just such a clean vermouth that allows the spirit to shine more. I like my manhattans with 2.5 oz rittenhouse and 1 oz carpano, 2 dashes of ango. Orange or lemon twist or just amarena cherry depending on what I'm feeling.

Here are some other vermouth brands to get familiar with (these brands usually also make dry or bianco/blanco vermouths as well):

French (usually more floral, light, beautiful): Dolin, Noilly Prat

Italian (usually more earthy, herbal, dark): Cocchi, mancino",1585157260

181,cocktails,"That's a good question. Unless it's a speakeasy where they're supposed to have a hidden, exclusive feel to them, bars will usually show you what they're about before you even step in. Breweries will show off their taps, even tanks in the back. Cocktail bars always have their shelves stocked with large varieties of liquors and liqueurs, and you can almost always count on them having bitters or garnishes on the bar counter, usually do not use soda guns. You know you are at a local dive bar when you see the bartender making a highball drink in 2 seconds. one hand holds the liquor, other hand holds the soda gun. Whiskey spots will have majority whiskey bottles up on display, and so on.
That said, there are no hard and fast rules. Get a feel for the place, the atmosphere, what people have in their hands. As a general rule, quieter places usually have drinks that take longer to make (""fancier"" cocktails). The loudest venues usually have the easiest drinks (clubs and dives).

188,cocktails,"I didn't grow up in the states so I started going out to bars and clubs when I was around 16. When I was around that age, I was drinking gin and tonics, vodka sodas, whiskey cokes (please, at least take JD), rum and cokes, mojitos, vodka redbulls, long islands. Basically, just highballs. They're cheap and get you going. Unless I have a table at a club, I'm probably sticking with these still today.

When I got sick of the louder scenes (wasn't really a fan to begin with) I started frequenting nice cocktail bars that served classic cocktails. That's where I started learning about whiskey sours, manhattans, old-fashioneds, negronis, sazeracs, martinezs, martinis and so on. I started frequenting those kinds of places and got more and more familiar with what I liked and disliked. 

The most important thing is to know what kind of bar you are going to and order accordingly. The best advice I can give you right now is to just **drink more** and **figure out what you like** and then branch out from there. You like whiskey? Try a whiskey sour. Then try the sour format in daiquiri (rum) and gin sours and gimlets (lime instead of lemon) and so on. Margaritas are just sours with orange liqueur, which will make it stronger. Mojitos are basically daiquiris with mint and soda. These are oversimplifications but once you understand these drinks better, you can look back at this post in 1-2 years time and be like oh yea, I totally get what you're saying now.

 If you like stronger drinks, old-fashioned, manhattan, negroni are drinks that can get you started.",1585115635

Your off-ramp dive probably won't have the supplies or knowledge on hand to make you a Penicillin or Last Word, but they can certainly make manhattans or martinis.

**Twelve Mile Limit**

*Recipe Reference:* [Ted Haigh](https://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/wiki/ncotw/twelve_mile_limit)

*Summary:*

During Prohibition, people would technically leave the United States, whose jurisdiction legally ended 3 miles off shore in international waters. This led to the Three Mile Limit cocktail, a combination of brandy and rum with a dash of lemon juice and grenadine, invented by ‚ÄúChips‚Äù Brighton, a bartender at the famed Harry‚Äôs New York Bar in Paris. It‚Äôs not good.  Don‚Äôt make it.

Also taking advantage of the 3 mile limit were the cargo ships with Canadian and Caribbean rum and whiskey (Rum Row). To make rum running more difficult, the US changed the maritime limit to 12 miles on April 21, 1924

The result was the name of the Twelve Mile Limit cocktail, originally concocted by Thomas Franklin Fairfax Millard and documented in a newspaper article published in 1934. The Twelve Mile Limit takes the Three Mile Limit, turns the proportions of brandy and rum around, and adds some rye whiskey, resulting in a surprisingly smooth and lively cocktail extremely suitable for an ironic toast to Prohibition.

*Ingredients:*

* 1 ounce rum
* 1/2 ounce rye
* 1/2 ounce cognac
* 1/2 ounce lemon juice
* 1/2 ounce grenadine
* lemon twist, garnish

*Directions:*

Shake in an iced cocktail shaker and strain into a (well-chilled) cocktail glass. Garnish with a lemon twist.",1585107100

251,cocktails,"One of my favorite prohibition-era drinks, the 12 mile limit refers to how many miles out at sea you had to be in order to be outside the US borders to consume alcohol. It used to be 5, but too many people started partying on boats just offshore, so Congress extended it. The original drink calls for white rum, rye, brandy, lemon, and grenadine. All of these ingredients were found commonly in US bars of the day, and they all play together beautifully. However, I wanted to play around with the spirits to start and see how this combo worked. (Spoiler alert: it's awesome)



8 Mile Run


¬Ω oz (15 ml) Wray and Nephew overproof rum

¬æ oz (22.5 ml) apple brandy (I used VSOP Calvados, but bonded American apple brandy would be great as well)

¬æ oz (22.5 ml) blended Irish whiskey (anything with a light, honey-forward palate)

¬Ω oz (15 ml) grenadine

¬Ω oz lime juice


Put everything in a shaker with ice, shake it up and strain it into a chilled coupe.

When I first tried Wray and Nephew, the first thing that came to mind of all things was apples, so it only made sense to pair it with apple brandy. From there I wanted a lighter kind of whiskey that would act as a good backbone, and I've had some prior experience with mixing brandies and Irish whiskies to know that they work together very well.


Overall, this drink tastes like honeyed apples and bright berries, with a touch of Jamaican rum funk underneath. I'm debating adding grapefruit, a dash of campari, or even creme de cassis in place of the grenadine. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated üòä cheers!",1585104556

INGREDIENTS
Serving: 1

1 1/2 ounces white rum, preferably Street Pumas Panamanian Rum or Plantation 3 Star Rum
3/4 ounce Galliano L‚ÄôAutentico
1/2 ounce Cointreau

278,cocktails,"Homemade banana liqueur - because it takes a really long time to use up 26oz of banana liqueur. 

Recipe:

- 1 cup rum (this time I used Coruba Dark)
- 2 ripe bananas, peeled and sliced
- 1/2 cup Honey Syrup
- 1/2 tsp Cinnamon 

Add rum, cinnamon, and bananas to a jar and let rest.  For extra funk, stick it in the window to catch some sun.  Strain, and add honey syrup to taste.  Mine sat in the window for about 5 days.

Straining and filtering is a bit of a messy ordeal, but some patience will eventually get you the results you are after.  Use the leftover banana to make syrup, or dry in the oven for some fancy, funky garnish.

How does it taste?  This version brings the funk and the flavor.  The rum and banana are bold, the honey adds it's own unique flavor, and the cinnamon adds some wonderful spice.  I will be using it in cocktails in the days to come, but I definitely recommend making your own.  This is the second time I made banana liqueur, and both times it turned out great!",1585101595

Quarantiki
 

2oz Kirkland Signature London Dry Gin

1.5oz Kraken black rum

0.75oz to 1oz Velvet Falernum

3oz pineapple juice

1.5oz fresh orange juice (I used 2 blood oranges)

Juice from half a lime (0.5oz?)

0.25 - 0.5 oz orgeat

440,cocktails,This is awesome. Can't wait to try a few ideas - totally didn't expect a togarashi tincture!,1585082950
441,cocktails,"I love Roku gin, it's so delicate and beautiful.

Someone else has already white negronis, which this is perfect for. Roku's botanicals can get a little lost in a normal negroni.

If you're in Japan you'll be able to find stores that sell this awesome yuzu marmalade/honey with the green cap. This ingredient is super versatile, even bringing a slight bitterness into the mix. With that you can make something I call the 'I Love Yu(zu)' lol

* 2oz Roku
* .75oz yuzu honey
* .75oz lime juice
* give it a shakey shake
* Either a light sprinkling of sansho pepper over the top, or a plum salt/powder rim. Both these ingredients may be hard to find but it definitely gives a slight edge that I love

_______

#tea 

     Genma icha or ‚Äòpopped ride kernel green tea‚Äô

     Jasmine tea 

     White tea 

     Ginger tea 

     Sesame tea 


#spice

You can also go this route to accentuate the existing botanicals and create a togarashi tincture.  I did this in the past by adding dried ready made togarashi to grain alcohol then cutting with water.  

I‚Äôve also made a wasabi tincture using similar methods and you could also soak grain alcohol in nori strips to get some umami flavors to work with.

# Fruits to use:

     Lychee (weak lychee flavor aka super diluted pur√©e)
  
     Watermelon (fresh juice) 

     Plum goes great with roku (1 dash plum bitters)

     Rhubarb (steeped and strained like tea)

     Lemon (yuzu and lime are too strong) 

     Almond (some kind of softer orgeat)


#Examples

1 

     2 oz roku 
     .5 white tea cordial 
     1 dash rhubarb bitters 
     3 dash wasabi tincture 

     
Stir over big rock - should be light but fragrant rhubarb should compliment your roku botanicals and the wasabi lifts the cocktail aromatically. White tea to fife is sugar while keeping with the theme.

2
     
     2 oz roku 
     .5 watermelon juice 
     .5 jasmine tea cordial 
     Barspoon orgeat 
     Barspoon lemon juice 

Shake orgeat, tea cordial and watermelon juice with 1 cube.  Strain into glass and add gin and lemon juice.  Stir.  Should be bright and floral without over powering the roku.

3

     2 oz roku  
     .5 sesame tea cordial 
     3 dash togarashi tincture 
     1 dash plum bitters or barspoon diluted lychee pur√©e 

Stir over big rock - should have some depth of flavor from the sesame and tannins of tea added with some small spice and plum to bring out the fruity notes.

#Edit

Knew I forgot some things. 

Look at 

     lemon grass 
     Kaffir lime leaves 
     Turmeric 
     Mint 
     Eucalyptus 
     Aloe 
     Cucumber 
     Apple 

As potential additional flavors to look into.

497,cocktails,"Gin and tonic formats are great to explore new gins, but here is something different.

This is a recipe I tried to replicate from Bar Goto in Lower East Side Manhattan called the Yuzu Sour:

* 2 oz sansho-pepper infused gin (they use roku)
* .75 oz lemon juice
* .75 oz cane syrup
* 2 tsp yuzu marmalade
* Sansho leaf, for garnish (at the bar they also rim the glass with this beautiful sansho pepper grounds and some other stuff the bartender wouldn't disclose)

What I can do in 10 minutes to make a very similar drink:

* 2 oz roku gin
* .75 oz lemon juice
* .75 oz simple syrup
* 1 yuzu peel (muddle first if you aren't good at the hard shake)
* two sprinkles of ground up numbing pepper (i happen to have the red sichuan variety)

Hard shake and strain

The yuzu and numbing pepper bring out those beautiful notes already present in roku gin, and the double numbing effect of yuzu peel and the pepper also tone down the bitter aftertaste often disliked by many about the roku gin (including me). If you have the habit of adding a drop or two of saline solution to your sours, forego it for this one.",1585076425

You could omit the club soda if you don't have any.  Try some variations on that. The grapefruit soda is pretty low in sugar (7g per bottle, so 2.0 oz is only adding about 2g of sugar), but adds just enough sweetness and flavor to really balance the cocktail.

Not only does heating the mixture result in evaporation, which is very difficult to control, it can cause a sucrose inversion which breaks the sucrose molecules down to fructose (sweeter than sugar) and glucose (less sweet), resulting in less consistency drink to drink.

A Bobby Burns is nice, which also involves Benedictine. There's a Churchill, which you'd need Cointreau for, in addition to the previous mentioned stuff.

370,cocktails,"This is a good question. The filtration does not capture ethanol, but because filtering can take so long you will lose some ethanol content to ambient evaporation, especially because ethanol has a lower boiling point (170F) than water. You'll also lose 15% to 25% of your input volume between the casein curds and the phenolic compounds and particles the filtration catches.

Unfortunately the math to calculate final ABV in these is really tough. I think because sugar content is stable, you could use a hydrometer and adjust for the Brix and find the finished ABV. I tend to just go by the input ABV, assuming there's some sort of equilibrium between evaporation and filtration mass-loss.

The reason you taste very little alcohol is because the dairy-fat emulsion in the milk punch. The sensory receptor on our tongues that binds to ethanol is TRPV-1, the same one that binds with capsaicin and creates our feeling of spiciness (which is actually a pain receptor). TRPV-1 is  covered with a thin layer of lipids, and the emulsion of fats in milk punches acts as a binding antagonist, preventing our receptors from sensing as much of the presence of alcohol. There's still orthonasal reception though, so you can tell if your drink is really boozy on the finish if it has an alcoholy vapor coming back up your throat to your nose.",1584901751

- .25 oz Maraschino
- .5 oz Simple Syrup
- 2 Orange Half Slices
- 2 Lemon Peels
- 3 dashes of Smoked Orange Bitters
- 2 dashes of Angostura bitters

Muddle Orange Slices and and Lemon Peels in bottom of mixing glass or tin with Maraschino, Simple Syrup and Bitters.

Fill 3/4 of mixing glass with ice. Add Bourbon and mix until ice is slightly melted and ingredients are combined (maybe 40-50 stirs). 

Pour and strain into rocks glass. I prefer over 1 large ice cube. 




** for hop-infused bourbon

- 2 cups of bourbon (I used makers)
- 3 tablespoons of dry, hops flowers
- 2 tablespoons of bitter orange peel

Combine all ingredients in some form of a sealed jar. Shake and leave in cool, dark area for 2-3 days or until you can smell the scent of the bourbon change. Strain and funnel into another container or empty glass bottle. The ones with the swing tops are rad.

The bourbon had a nice bitter finish for me. The hops really came through. The dry ingredients I got from a local herb store. If you happen to live in Philly, there‚Äôs a place called Herbiary at Reading Terminal that had both of these, amongst other really cool dry herbs that can be used for infusions.

50,cocktails,"So here's what's happening for you, you're drinking a cocktail aimed really at people who are seasoned drinkers: a traditional old fashioned. This is meant to elevate a spirit (whiskey in this case) so you can get all the nuances of it.

The problem is that your palate isn't accustomed to the alcoholic heat yet so you're not really getting those nuances. It's like someone who doesn't eat spicy food eating a hot dish with habaneros - I love it But that other person will think it tastes bad and/or it's really hard to eat.

So here's my suggestion: based on what you've said you liked, try sours. They're a class of cocktail that consist of three major parts: spirit, citrus, and sweet. In a certain way, the Irish breakfast fits this profile (granted though, it is a VERY sweet drink but that helps to ease the heat from the alcohol).

So, my suggestion would be to try something like this:

2 oz rum

.75 oz lime juice (fresh)

.75 oz simple syrup

Shake with ice, double strain into a chilled glass. If the heat is still too high, try a 1:1:1 ratio and gradually work your way up to a higher rum/other stuff ratio. Keep in mind the base spirit is extremely important - garbage in, garbage out.

This is another of those drinks that elevates a spirit BUT it also has other things that bring down that alcoholic heat. If you take this general formula, you can make a ton of drinks and try things that might be more palatable for you. Try a whiskey sour! You've got the whiskey already. Maybe a gamble or a Tom Collins! Another good thing is these don't require more bottles to buy, just fresh stuff and you can easily make your own simple syrup at home, takes like 5-10 minutes.

So try things like that or a Tom Collins. They take the spirit and lengthen it with something (like a mixer) to take the heat off. Eventually, you'll stop feeling that heat so strongly and it'll allow those wonderful nuances to come out - that's when you come back to the old fashioned and give it another go.",1584861338

It combines whiskey-spiked sparkling wine with baking soda to create an explosively fizzing drink that‚Äôs almost as fun to watch as it is to drink.

I *highly* recommend watching the [full video](https://youtu.be/9-v0izL709U) for this one to see the full fizzing reaction. [Here‚Äôs the timestamp](https://youtu.be/9-v0izL709U?t=180) if you want to get to the good bit. There‚Äôs also heaps more info throughout on the inspo, so check it out if you‚Äôre a curious Fallout fan.

**Recipe**

**For the cocktail:**

* 1 oz (30ml) Famous Grouse scotch
* 0.5 (15ml) elderflower liqueur
* Sparkling wine

**For the Mentat:**

* 1 altoid-style mint
* Peychaud‚Äôs Bitters
* Red food dye
* Baking soda

Add the mint to a small glass and cover with bitters and red food dye. Leave for 10 minutes. Strain and dip into baking soda, leave for another 10 minutes. *Thoroughly* shake off excess baking soda and place into a champagne flute. Emphasis on thoroughly - you‚Äôll end up with a soda-y cocktail otherwise.

Add the sparkling white wine, leaving some room at the top. Enjoy the fizz! Add the Famous Grouse and elderflower liqueur. Garnish with a lemon peel. Serve!

**Tasting notes:** Refreshingly minty with a floral start and a long malty finish.

**Best paired with:** A nuclear sunset.

I mentioned in another comment that adding a bit to a White Russian gives it a little extra character.  I eventually decided that I prefer it without, but it's nice every now and then.

131,cocktails,"As I understand it (and I'm no pro, amateur enthusiast here), Last Word variations are in equal parts, and use spirit, fruit, bitter liqueur, and sweeter liqueur. Its a lot about how the flavors interact with each other. For this bourbon variation, the first choice would be to sub the lime for lemon. From there I'd guess that the chartreuse gets subbed with aperol because its flavors lend more to interacting well with the lemon. Then since (in my opinion) the aperol is less complex than the chartreuse, you need something that lends sweetness, complexity, and adds to the dimension of the citrus flavors while also catering to the warmth of the bourbon. And so nonino is subbed for maraschino.

The [PDT](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pdt-cocktails/id968492836)/Total Tiki/rest of the Doudoroff apps have similar features, and your ingredients sync between the apps, which is a nice touch.

Muddle Orange Slices and and Lemon Peels in bottom of mixing glass or tin with Maraschino, Simple Syrup and Bitters.

** for hop-infused bourbon

- 2 cups of bourbon (I used makers)
- 3 tablespoons of dry, hops flowers
- 2 tablespoons of bitter orange peel

Combine all ingredients in some form of a sealed jar. Shake and leave in cool, dark area for 2-3 days or until you can smell the scent of the bourbon change. Strain and funnel into another container or empty glass bottle. The ones with the swing tops are rad.

The bourbon had a nice bitter finish for me. The hops really came through. The dry ingredients I got from a local herb store.

124,cocktails,"I hate to say it, but you've been sold some good old fashioned snake oil my friend.

All proper absinthe sold in the US (Pernod, Clandestine, Butterfly, Kubler, Lucid, Jade, Mansinthe, Violet Crown, Tennyson, Vieux Carre, Vieux Pontarlier ... Literally anything with wormwood) contains Thujone. US imports are maxxed at 10mg/L concentrations, EU bottles at 35 (as you have here). It's been legal since 2007, once better testing methods were demonstrated. 

There was an analysis of pre-ban vintage absinthes done awhile back that showed levels of .5 - 48.3mg/l. I.e. a good number of them would be able to be legally sold today. Not super romantic, but science can be that way some times.

So why were people going crazy and murdering babies (or whatever) then!?

Because a study (sponsored by the wine industry) said so. No proof, the doctor they paid said so. Wine sales were down and they sponsored a study to fuck with absinthe and get drinkers back.

The real culprit was the fact that absinthe is generally 120-140 proof, combine a lot of drinking that (and just crippling alcoholism in general) with you know .... Opiates, and you have a genuine problem. I've drank 30mg/l absinthe on a number of occasions, and yup, it gets you drunk. Anything beyond that is just placebo, really.

Now Thujone does have hallucinogenic properties in high enough dosage. Thing is, you'll be dead from alcohol poisoning long before that becomes even on the table.

The Czech absinthe category has long been regarded as low quality nonsense, basically manufactured for tourists (it's the only one where lighting a sugar cube on fire for spectacle is common, because the actual liquid to too low abv to ignite, try that with a 'real' absinthe and you might wind up with a glass full of on fire liquid). If it's not French, Swiss, or from a handful of boutique US producers, it's probably pretty poor quality in the grand scheme of things. 

Enjoy it for what it is... a novelty, but odds are you could have found something significantly higher quality at a liquor store in most major US metropolitan areas that wasn't based in fairytale.",1584772703

*Recipe By:* Steve Cutchen

*Summary:* 

A riff on the Bourbon Sidecar (Carrozzino is Italian for sidecar), the lemon juice is replaced with limoncello. What‚Äôs gained is depth. The tradeoff is less sour. Bitters are added to cut the sweetness a bit.

*Ingredients:*

* 2 ounces bourbon
* 1 1/2 ounce Cointreau
* 1 ounce limoncello
* 2 dashes orange bitters

*Directions:*

Combine bourbon, Cointreau, limoncello, and bitters in an iced mix glass and stir to chill. Strain into the chilled, iced cocktail glass, and serve.",1584754343

245,cocktails,"**French 105**

*Recipe By:* Steve Cutchen

*Summary:* 

The French 75 as commonly served today is the British version with gin replacing the French cognac. The idea is that champagne replaces the club soda in a Tom Collins, effectively doubling the alcohol by volume (8% abv to 15.5% abv for this recipe) making for a kick like the classic 75-mm French artillery piece used in World War I.

But what if you also replaced (almost all of) the lemon juice and simple syrup with an alcoholic substitute; say, limoncello.  Now you have an even stronger kick (20.5% abv).  That is the French 105.

In World War II, the French had a lot of 75-mm guns left in their arsenal. It was hard to convince politicians to allocate money for new artillery. But eventually they joined most other countries and standardized on the 105-mm howitzer. A more powerful gun. A more powerful kick, and the perfect nomenclature for this more powerful cocktail.

*Ingredients:*

* 1 ounce gin (British), or cognac (French Traditionnel)
* 1 ounce limoncello
* 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
* 3 ounces champagne
* lemon twist, to garnish

*Directions:*

Combine gin, lemon juice, limoncello, and ice in a mix glass. Stir until well chilled and strain into an iced Collins glass. Most folks use a champagne flute. But a normal French 75 is, after all, a Tom Collins with champagne instead of soda. So, based on Morgenthaler's suggestion, I make it this way. Top with Champagne, give a gentle stir to bring it together, and garnish with a lemon twist to serve

*Notes:*

Start with a **Tom Collins**, keep the club soda but replace the lemon and simple syrup with limoncello and you‚Äôve got the **Tom Cello**.",1584754187

441,cocktails,"Yes, a few suggestions. I've made about twenty milk punches of my own creation over the last year, and I keep a running list of notes from what I've learned (often the hard way) from my experiments.

First, the conditions under which proteins in milk (dairy or nondairy) agglomerate (curdle) are variable by acidity, tannins, and heat, among other things. Nondairy milks are tougher to curdle than dairy whole milk. One way is to split your ingredients into curdling ingredients (which will be added together directly to the milk) and ingredients that will be added after the curdle. Ethanol is pH neutral, but aged spirits have absorbed acids and tannins from aging in wood. Sugar syrup is also pH neutral. Try reserving your amaro montenegro and sweetening agent and adding just your Jameson and citrus to the milk to curdle it. You'll also want the coconut milk to be very hot, probably around 170F.

Second, I'd suggest using a blend of coconut milk and another nut milk. Like others have said, coconut milk is high-fat and low-protein‚Äîthe opposite of what you want for this. The fat in coconut milk is alcohol soluble, so it will absorb into your drink. A drink with even 20% coconut milk is going to taste unbearably fatty, in my experience. Soy milk is closest in composition to whole milk. Other options are almond milk and oat milk. Try a fifty-fifty split.

I also suggest using powdered culinary acid instead of fresh citrus and decaffeinated tea.",1584716532

However, when making it for friends I have had a better response with slightly more of the Giffard and passion fruit, less sherry, and substituting lime for lemon juice, with the resulting sweeter cocktail allowing the fruit and almond flavors to take center stage.

So you could do all sorts of stuff.  Infuse clear spirits.  Make a syrup out of it and use it for whatever just steeping the butterfly pea flower in hot water like tea and adding in sugar (or whatever sweetener but if you go with honey, agave, turbinado or some other sweetener that's brown it might loose some luster).  You could just make a butterfly tea and spike that with a cocktail, hot or cold.  Or maybe acid correct it with citric and malic acids and use it as a balancing acid.

So I cringe every time I see some poor kid on Instagram make a ""color changing \[whatever\].""

285,cocktails,"So I decided to play around with the popular Last Word tonight. Originally I made this with Triple Sec (actually Grand Marnier) in place of the Maraschino (never had any) which is apparently the Written Word. It's my wife's favourite cocktail. Or was. Wanting to try my hand at the original I thought I'd make a few, taste test, and pick a favorite.

All drinks are equal parts (1/2oz since I made 5 and chartruse is $$). Shaken over ice and strained. 

Without further adieu, The Last Lineup: 

On the far right, The Written Word:
    Gin (H Clark)
    Green Chartruse
    Triple Sec (Stirrings)
    Fresh lime

The original favorite, still delicious, least sweet of the bunch.

Next, the original, The Last Word:
    Gin
    Chartruse
    Maraschino
    Fresh lime 

Also delicious. Noticeably sweeter with the maraschino. Cherry and lime is always a winner. 

Skipping the middle and moving to #4,
The Final Ward:
    Rye (Old Forester)
    Chartruse
    Maraschino
    Fresh lemon

Easily the sweetest. When up against the other 3 it's almost too sweet for me. But the lemon is great in it and it's still tasty. 

On the end is the no name. Being a riff on a riff (a rye version of the Written Word) I hadn't found it out on the interwebs with a name, so my wife named it. 
The Spoken Word: 
    Rye
    Chartruse
    Triple Sec
    Fresh lemon

So good. The new winner for her and a contender for me.

Rankings: 
Final Ward is tasty but very sweet. Only one I could pick out if I didn't have the others to compare probably. 

Last Word and Written Word are both delicious, one with cherry notes and the other with orange.

Winner by a hair is the newcomer, Spoken Word. The Rye adds bit more fullness and richness to the taste.

Overall, those three would be difficult to distinguish at a bar though.

The middle drink was a total shot in the dark (and it missed). I bought the Forthave ""Red"" Aperitivo (a sweeter campari sub) and really wanted to try a spin on Last Word with it. I tried bourbon, chartruse, fresh blood orange (because...I dunno it sounded good), and Red and it was an overly sweet mess. So I swapped in gin instead. Much better and more rounded but still needs playing around with. I know nothing about Aperitifs so this is just me winging it. Current working name is The F Word. C&amp;C welcome.",1584609786

145,cocktails,"If you're gonna pick up a bottle of absinthe, be careful to avoid bad stuff! There's a decent amount of undrinkable crap that stores stock. The price floor for drinkable absinthe is about $50 (for Kubler, Duplais, or, if you're lucky, La Clandestine.) A gold standard bottle--Jade is the benchmark for product available in the USA--will set you back $80-100. But that bottle will last you a long time, because absinthe is meant to be substantially watered down (like 3:1 water to spirit *minimum*) and has a pretty potent flavor. So a standard absinthe drip, the drink where you'll use the largest quantity of the spirit, ends up being a quite long drink and not the sort of thing you'd drink multiple of in one sitting.

Make sure you *do not* buy any of the following:

* Absente
* Grand Absente
* La Fee
* Mata Hari

With rare exception, any product that leans too heavily into hallucination-related imagery in their branding (name, label, etc.) or is branded as ""absinth"" (without the ""e"") is likely to be of lesser quality.

There are a lot of bottles that range from good to amazing, so I won't give a complete list of recommended absinthes, but some solid ones if you're able to find them, mostly in order of rec:

* any Jade product (1901, VS 1898, Esprit Edouard, Terminus Oxygenee, Nouvelle-Orleans)
* Delaware Phoenix Meadow of Love (sweeter and quite lovely, no need for sugar) and Walton Waters (more classic) 
* Pacifique
* La Clandestine
* Kubler
* Duplais Blanche and Verte

I usually use Monkey Shoulder as the base but tried Glenmorangie 10 recently and it worked great too. Just something mild (like your Jura). Then anything like Ardbeg, Laphroaig, Lagavulin etc to float. Cheers!",1584544651

Tiki wise, you can do a lot, but the more merrier. Not sure how accessible, but pineapple juice, orange juice, and falernum or orgeat go a long way.

45ml Brandy - Hennessey VSOP

20ml Apple Brandy - Lobo from South Australia

20ml sweet Vermouth - Casa Mariol Negre

Orange zest garnish

METHOD

Prepare you orange garnish.

Add Brandy, Apple Brandy &amp; sweet Vermouth into your mixing glass. Fill your mixing glass with ice and stir until diluted to your desired taste.

Hold the ice back with your Julep strainer.

Give the orange garnish a sharp fold over the top of the glass to express the citrus oils. Twist and add the garnish.

CORPSE REVIVER NUMBER 2: Really delicious and refreshing! 

20ml Gin - Tanqueray

20ml Cocchi Americano 

20ml Marionette Curacao

20ml lemon juice

Absinthe rinse

Lemon twist garnish

METHOD:

The easiest way to achieve the ‚Äòrinse‚Äô is to find a little atomiser like the kind used for perfume. Just remember that this is just a supporting act here so don‚Äôt overdo it! 

If you don‚Äôt have an atomiser, just pop a little dribble in to your glass and swirl it round, trying to get as close to the rim of the glass as possible, then discard the rest.

Craddock‚Äôs original recipe doesn‚Äôt feature a twist, so purists will say this drink should be unadorned. Personally, I like the lift a lemon twist gives it, and if you‚Äôre going to squeeze the lemon anyway may as well make use of the zest! Waste not want not‚Ä¶

Add all your ingredients into a your tin. Fill with ice &amp; shake hard.

Double strain in to your chilled, absinthe rinsed coupe.

If you're using a twist, give it a sharp fold or two to expel the oils over the drink and glass, then twist it so you can lay it nicely over the edge of the coupe.

CORPSE REVIVER NUMBER 3: I wouldn't bother, it's as bad as it sounds!

INGREDIENTS

The juice of a 1/4 Lemon (I used 20 mls)

1 Jigger Pernod (I went for 45 mls because it‚Äôs a big glass)

Champagne (working in a Spanish restaurant I went for Cava instead)

Good ice

A highball glass

METHOD

Add the lemon juice and Pernod to the highball glass, fill with ice, then with Cava &amp; stir gently - but I really wouldn‚Äôt bother.

340,cocktails,"Personally I feel like people are giving you too much flack for the wrong things. If you don't mind, I'm going to jot down a few thoughts. 

I've seen two predominant styles of old fashioneds--- one with a serious orange slice that's muddled with a sugar cube or simple, and one that uses an expressed orange zest to give the drink an orange aromatic. In the former you need a whole ass piece of orange. In the latter, you want just the zest, and as little pith (white bitter part) as possible. 

People get weird about simple syrup vs sugar cubes. Personally, for home use I get why a sugar cube is a great idea. You're always going to get a uniform amount of sweetness, and it's hard to measure out a quarter oz, or a couple bsp of simple. Ultimately simple in an old fashioned is totally fine. Even super high end bars will use simple, it's way easier to mix a syrup into your bourbon than straight up sugar. 

To the people advocating Cointreau or gran marnier, sure it may seem like an elegant alternative to simple, but you can always throw in a dash of orange bitters, and you're not dealing with extra booze (with a different base) in an already boozy cocktail. IMO a properly expressed orange twist can add a lot of orange to an old fashioned without going over the top. 

Finally just a friendly question--- How much have you diluted? Personally my go to is a beaker mixer mostly full of ice, 10-15 second quick stir. If you're serving on the rocks, closer to 10. Personally I'd use more ice in your final product, but ymmv. 

Any way sorry, my bar has been closed recently so I'm jonesing to make drinks. Personally I think an old fashioned at its best highlights the characteristics of whatever bourbon (or spirit) you're using. It can also just cover the shitty bourbon you have on hand with sugar and orange. 

In any case best of luck, and feel free to contact me if you want to talk cocktails.",1584493511

As a continuation of my last post, there are a few home made ingredients here, but fewer than before. If I could run to the store to buy Ruby grapefruit in good conscience, I would. It will likely go on the ""emergency supplies"" list soon.

The cinnamon simple is a 2:1 ratio simple syrup except that I toasted the (Ceylon) cinnamon first and then let it steep for an hour before I strained into my squirt bottle. The first time I made this I went 1:1 and I think I like that better. Next bottle will return to that pattern. Also, this second version seems to be doing that ""honey crystallization"" thing in my fridge.

The grenadine is 1:1 by volume Pom Wonderful pommegranite juice and white sugar. Way better than store bought grenadine.

Overall, I'd say this was a bit too sweet for my taste. Probably fine for most. When trying again I'd go with real grapefruit juice. I love the combo of grapefruit and cinnamon, but it was a bit lost here. I'd give it a 6/10, but that's what experiments are for!",1584491182

\*It's important to use lots of tea bags for the tea and to steep it about five minutes or more. You want to extract lots of tannins, because you'll lose many of them and you want the flavors and astringency to survive the milk wash.

* 2oz (60) peanut butter infused bourbon (recipe below)

* 1 barspoon creme de cacao

* 1 dash chocolate bitters

* 1 dash angostura bitters


-Add all ingredients to a mixing glass

-Stir for 45 seconds

-Strain into a rocks glass with a big clear cube

-Cut a peanut butter patty cookie in half and place on top of the ice cube


*Peanut Butter Infused Bourbon*

* 16oz (150g) natural unsalted creamy peanut butter

* 1 bottle (750ml) bourbon

-Spread peanut butter across the bottom of a baking dish

134,cocktails,"Weeeeeell, it's complicated and I'm not an engineer, chemist, or food scientist so take this not as gospel but suggestion (and you go test out a few things to see what works).

Firstly there's the ""will it freeze?"" Question.

If you're sticking with something that's 20% or less ABV, it should freeze in a cold freezer if left long enough - this assuming you're taking a liquor/liqueur and adding in an amount to get the whole mixture to 20% or less. The exact temperature would be around ehhhh... 22F I think. This is ignoring the second factor though:

""How much sugar is in it?"" Ice cream will be very sugary which unfortunately depresses the freezing temperature. If I were to take a GUESS I would say around 15F is where you'll end up needing to freeze. I would go lower though for two reasons:

1, you want to be sure it freezes well and doesnt just separate.

2, you want the mixture to stay frozen long enough to enjoy the feeling of it being frozen in your mouth, which, you'll be surprised is actually a real problem. You pop it in your mouth and it immediately melts.

In any case, try one and split it into several mini batches then add different amounts of alcohol to each. This'll allow you to figure out what works best before you're serving it to people (assuming this is for a party or something).

As for a choice of liquor... Hard to say. What does this thing taste like? I've never had this kind of ice cream before. Vodka is the wrong call though, you'll be adding a bunch of water that wasn't there before. If you're looking for something that adds no taste to the product, go with everclear as high ABV as you can find then calculate out how much you need.

However, I usually find that there's nothing vodka can do that gin or rum can't do better. Give me some flavor notes of your ice cream and I'll be better able to recommend something.",1584426341

It's pretty versatile and it'll be similar enough to give you an idea for the cocktail (Lazy amaro recipe: drop an Oz of the stuff into a pint of white beer, really deepens the flavor)

The difference is that homemade syrups extract flavors by cooking them, whereas homemade infusions and store-bought liqueurs extract flavor through cold maceration. There are real chemical differences in ""cooked"" flavors; a good example is gingerol vs. zingerone in ginger. Liqueurs are infusions of fruit or herbs macerated in a base spirit and heavily sweetened. So one difference is that syrups will extract water-soluble flavor compounds, while liqueurs and infusions extract alcohol-soluble compounds and water-soluble compounds (since the base spirits are not pure ethanol). On top of that, syrups add flavor and sugar without alcohol; liqueurs add flavor, spirit, and alcohol.

In general, though, I like to approximate liqueurs with my own homemade version when the produce is in season and I can nab it for cheap. It also lets me dial-in ABV and sugar content to my liking. But liqueurs do capture economics of scale, so I wouldn't make my own lychee liqueur, for example, because lychee is an import where I live and I couldn't ever do it for as cheap as the store-bought liqueurs.",1584388805
326,cocktails,Says you!,1584388720
327,cocktails,"I assume there's a complicated molecular reason but the only thing I can think of is that more cocktails use Liqueurs than syrups, so buying the liqueur makes the flavour more easily applicable to other cocktails.

1 barspoon Luxardo Maraschino
Dash of lemon juice

I‚Äôm cheap and wanted to get the most volume for my money, so no fancy vermouths in this recipe.

406,cocktails,"There's ummmm ....... A LOT of things I just simply can't get behind here.

Seems pretty sweet, but that's the least of my concerns.

2/2 on the bitters would get you shot in NOLA (and I'm in the huge minority that routinely sneaks just a touch of Ango in from time to time.) 

Sazeracs should never be on ice... Serve it up if you must (down is my only way I would,) but ice is heresy.

Smoking AND absinthe? That's just awkwardly doubling up on aromatics... Like, that's two dominant things just shitting all over each other. The point of the absinthe (in modern times) is to give this subtle aromatic kiss to compliment the bitters. This is straight grabbing you by the nosepussy and inviting you to the world least trustworthy ice cream van.

Lemon wheels over lemon peels are just ........ Nah.

Matter of fact, just nah to this whole fuckin thing, it's not even a Sazerac anymore my guy. It's just some fucked up, weird ass anise tinged old fashioned at this point. I tried to be constructive I promise but I can't, this is just every sin rolled into one.",1584366929

I think water will extract most of the flavor components in bitter ingredients, but probably not as fast and perhaps not as efficiently at the same temperature, so heating may be required (which will evaporate some of the flavor components), or a very good patience and clean ingredients (to prevent spoilage).

If you're using sugar cubes then it's 1 sugar cube. If it's 1:1 simple syrup then it's ¬º oz or 8 ml, if it's 2:1 simple it's 1 tsp or 5 ml. You can add an ounce of spirit, but that is a bit expensive; an Old Fashioned is not supposed to be a sweet drink, the sugar is merely supposed to round off the edges of the spirit.

As for the garnish, it's not really optional either. You need citrus oil for it to be an Old Fashioned. If it's lemon, orange, grapefruit, doesn't really matter, but it has to be there.

I don't want to sound like I'm gatekeeping the Old Fashioned, but it's a formula.

467,cocktails,"This is a **VERY** interesting question! And I can provide some limited data.

I have friends whose idea of a Martini was with vodka. Dammit. I've educated them that their drink is a great cocktail, but it is a Kangaroo. [\[1\]](https://euvs-vintage-cocktail-books.cld.bz/1943-Cocktail-Digest-by-Oscar-Haimo-of-the-Hotel-Pierre/49/), [\[2\]](https://euvs-vintage-cocktail-books.cld.bz/1946-The-Stock-Club-Bar-Book-by-Lucius-Beebe/90), [\[3\]](https://cold-glass.com/2011/02/21/what-was-your-first-cocktail/).  And since no one wants to order a Kangaroo in a bar, it's OK to order that drink as a Vodkatini.

So next we did some taste tests. And we actually used the gin you mention, Tanqueray N^(o.)10.

What we found was:

* Olives are wonderful in a Kangaroo. The clean vodka seems to handle the umami of an olive garnish well, especially if a bit of brine is going to be added. And a lemon twist in a Kangaroo is too bright, and frankly, uninteresting.  (*I‚Äôm not trying to add so much brine that it becomes the drink. I don‚Äôt want to overpower the vermouth. Two bar spoons works for me, But even just one is preferable to overdoing it. I‚Äôm not trying to add alcohol to a jar of olives.)*
* By comparison, gin and the briny nature of the olive seems to conflict. But the clean citrus of the lemon twist accents the herbal and spice flavors of a favorite gin mixed with the dry vermouth. 

So to each cocktail, its own, and to your taste is the final decision! 

Sure! I'll do olives in a Martini when I freaking want olives in a Martini.  I'll do three jalapeno stuffed sonsabiches... But if I want a true Martini experience, when I'm celebrating something, I'll do a twist. And sometimes, when I want olives, I'll do vodka, because a vodkatini is also a damn fine cocktail.",1584334736

Alexander Wollcott, a critic at the *New Yorker* and a radio personality, contributed the 'While Rome Burns',  claiming a half a dozen would 'improve your fiddling, help you to remember the wisecracks of Dorthy Parker, and may even lead you into retelling the story of Christmas at the Front.'

Recipe:

1 part lemon juice;

2 parts medford rum;

dash of maple syrup.

&amp;#x200B;

This is surprisingly good, though quite sweet --- medford is a blackstrap rum, and dark maple syrup adds another layer of sweet/smoke to it.

499,cocktails,"This year for St Patrick's Day I wanted to try something a little different, and I had seen another cereal infused Gin Fizz before, so decided to put my own spin on it. The Gin was infused with the green marshmallows from Lucky Charms cereal, and the cream was flavoured by the cereal itself before use. 

At first I wasn't sure if I'd be able to find Lucky Charms in time for me to make this before heading on holiday, so I looked up tasting notes and the best I could find was a beer flavoured like lucky charms that had ""notes of pear and citrus"" so that's why I've added a wee bit of pear syrup instead of simple. I also cut the syrup down since the dissolved marshmallows already added plenty of sweetness. 

Recipe:

* 2.5 oz Lucky Charms Marshmallow Infused Gin
* 0.5 oz Lime Juice
* 0.5 oz Lemon Juice
* 0.5 oz Pear Syrup
* 1 oz Cream
* 1 Egg White
* 1-2 oz Soda Water

Add everything except egg white and soda to a shaker with ice, shake vigorously for about 30 seconds, strain out the ice, add in the egg white and a smoothie ball and dry shake for a further 30 seconds, add to a highball glass, rest for about a minute then top with soda water until the foam head rises to just above the rim of the glass.",1584326919

The upshot of this method is that you can play around with mixing CO2 and N2O easily, because N2O is slightly sweet. Dave says that a carbonation run of two CO2 cartridges and one N2O cartridge approximates his favorite sparkling water.

For infusions: the easiest thing to play around with are cocoa nibs and jalapenos. I've also tried to do a rosemary infusion into gin and found that I needed much more rosemary than I thought (probably something like 60g leaves per 500mL of liquid at least).",1584317757

163,cocktails,"Well
Come the fuck on with a question like that.

Let‚Äôs just use basic common sense. 

They design a program to fit the space.  The people who come into a bar come in forms certain atmosphere and experience and drink ‚Äòstyle‚Äô.

The design their program to fit the venue in a way that this show of theatrics doesn‚Äôt hurt the other guests.  If it did then guess what? They wouldn‚Äôt be around as a bar for long.  

All y‚Äôall who work in ‚Äòhead down grind high volume venue bartending‚Äô don‚Äôt ever seem to enjoy someone else enjoying what they do or having a bit of a show while doing it.  

No one is going to die because they have to wait an extra 45 seconds for their cocktail so these three amigos can eelcer something special to a bar guest.  

This is also probably a $100+ group cocktail that gets rarely ordered and when it is ordered the extra hands make it go by faster! 

As a bar manager I‚Äôd rather have 3 bartenders stop what they are doing and crank one of these out in 45 seconds and get back to serving ALL the guests than have 1 bartender take 3 minutes to make this and have their portion of the bar suffer. 

You guys need to use some rational thinking before asking these kinds of questions.  OP works in a place where they can have some fun and deliver an experience and people are there to enjoy the show as much as the drinks.",1584300115

173,cocktails,None taken lol!

It's some guys free pouring a punch. You can debate free pour vs jigger all day, but that's another conversation outside the context of ""flair"". Punch historically was already kinda of a beverage built around showing off (the ingredients were expensive, lavish bowls, etc.). The whole fire thing in the beginning is super common in basically every tiki bar. Sure, there's a little spectacle and three guys built it in one minute instead of one guy doing it in 5.

It's worth at least trying some time.  I'm 58 yo and I definitely  let myself enjoy experiences like this from time to time.

I met my ex because of a cocktail, a [Bohemian Absinthe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDnvp9XwmBo) but made with French Absinthe, that I was drinking in a club like this.  

Strictly the club is a well-known meat-market/ex-pat bar in Taipei so ""party"" comes with the territory.  She saw the flames and came up to me to ask about it.  I bought her one and well that was the beginning of a wild ride. 

You can't get too precious about ""tradition"" because there is no such thing in the context of cocktails - most cocktails were invented in the 19th century or post-US-Prohibition so they are very new things historically.  

I typically drink Absinthe a la Bohemia, in the traditional French Impressionist period style or mixed with craft root beer, sarsaparilla, birch beer or other similar root soda.",1584291162

With birthday this weekend, my wife and I wanted to have a very small handful of close family and friends over for a sort of cocktail exploration party. The last time we did this was several years ago when we tried 5 different recipes for the Aviation. I've been looking forward to doing something like it again ever since. Last night we finally made it happen, and it was a blast.

A very warm thanks to u/Amo_Amari and u/UnknownVC for [answering my call](https://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/fgt2nq/birthday_flight_ideas/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) with their expert guidance on which fun directions I could take the night. (2nd Place choice, btw, went to the Rob Roy variations suggestion, but several of our guests looked a little apprehensive about the scotch.)

A big thanks, too, to u/Duffuser for [their post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/9e846t/can_we_start_a_master_list_of_last_word_variations/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) about creating a master list of Last Word variants. That was the menu that I pulled from that night, going from fairly safe to increasingly weird.

Every one of these drinks was really fun. I feel the Final Ward is a warmer palate, the Right Word is your refreshing summer version, the Industry Sour is probably the most impressive and multi-directional, and the Half Hour Flight is that one uncle who just goes and does his own thing at all the family gatherings.",1584254959

Recipe:

* 1.5 oz Etsu Japanese gin
* 1.5 oz Mountain Dew Baja Blast
*  Juice of 1/4 a large lime, or about 0.25 oz
* Build in glass over a large ice cube, then top with 3 heavy dashes of Angostura bitters

\*I originally posted a version with a 1:2 ratio a little while ago, but quickly took it down and replaced it with this, which is a little more in line with the tastes of this sub. 

I love using unusual ingredients in unexpected combinations, and in this case, I somehow discovered that Baja Blast complements this gin exceptionally well. Don't turn your nose up at the questionable mixer. There's a lot of room to play around with the ratios; at least up to 1:3, the gin still manages to really shine through even when it would normally be drowned out by anything else. At 1:3, I'd say it's kind of similar to a gin and tonic, but at 1:1 it almost reminds me more of a negroni. (Yes, I know that's a blasphemous claim, but try it yourself before you disagree.) 

This is a spirit-forward cocktail, and the choice of spirit does seem to matter for this. With Etsu, you can actually leave out the Angostura at a 1:2 or 1:3 ratio (in which case I'd call it a Tatsumaki Punch - yes, I am an otaku) and it's still very tasty. When I tried making it with Roku, however, it was still drinkable with the bitters, but nigh-unpalatable without. I can't test these since I don't have any on hand, but based on memory, I'm guessing that it would also work with Gunpowder or Tamworth Garden White Mountain gin (if you can find it), but not so well with Aviation, Beefeater, Bombay Sapphire, or Plymouth.

445,cocktails,"I‚Äôm stuck inside today (due to terrible weather, not quarantine) so I thought I would finish up another article I‚Äôve been working on, this time about the most popular group of fruits used in building cocktails. The photo is a variety of freeze-dried citrus wheels including lime, lemon, grapefruit, and Valencia, Car-Cara, and Moro blood oranges.

# Citrus

What do the Himalayas and orange juice have in common? Both can trace their origin back to the collision of the Indian subcontinent with Asia. As the plates collided and the ocean floor was lifted, the new mountain range altered weather patterns to intensify monsoon patterns and block cold air from Central Asia. A group of drought tolerant plants with small, leathery berries had the traits necessary to take advantage of this new climate. These early members of the citrus family likely looked similar to Sichuan pepper, a close cousin of the *Citrus* genus, and thrived in the cycles of wet and dry weather. A genetic mutation that yielded tastier fruits allowed them spread quickly with a little help from the local fauna.

**Family Tree**

Almost all commercial citrus fruits trace their ancestry back to just five species, Citrons (*Citrus medica*) Mandarins (*Citrus reticulata*) and Pomelos (*Citrus maxima*) and Papeda (*Citrus micrantha*) and kumquat (*Citrus japonica,* formerly *Fortunella japonica*). The citrus family is a bit promiscuous, the species and their hybrids will readily breed with each other, mixing and matching flavors, shapes, and sizes. Our habit of moving and breeding plants makes the genetics a little difficult to untangle but we do know that lemons and limes can be traced back to crosses between citrons and papeda, oranges are the offspring of mandarins and pomelos, and grapefruits are a relatively recent hybrid between oranges and pomelos that first showed up on the island of Barbados about 300 years ago. A colorful character named Odet Philippe was responsible for bringing the grapefruit to his plantation near Tampa Bay, kicking off a major part of the Florida citrus industry. 

Natural mutations also produced fruit such as the blood orange and Buddah‚Äôs hand, prized for their unique color and shape. Some of the finger limes of Australia (*Citrus australasica*) have become popular in international cuisine due to the unusual spherical shape of the juice vesicles, which are often listed on menus as citrus caviar.

India, southeast Asia, and northern Australia are the center of citrus evolution and these areas support the greatest diversity of Citrus species. While many of these species are slow growing and unpalatable, they do provide important sources of new genes for breeding disease resistant crops. Bacterial diseases such as Citrus Greening threaten citrus crops across the globe because most commercial citrus groves are planted with just a few varieties. For instance, navel oranges, being seedless, can only be propagated by grafting a twig onto a different rootstock, so all navel oranges are genetic clones.

**Anatomy**

Despite their transformation into large, juicy fruits, all citrus fruits from tiny kumquats to giant pomelos are still a type of thick-skinned berry called a hesperidium. The bright colored outer layer, the flavedo or zest, contains cells full of essential oils. The next layer, the albedo or pith, is spongy and bitter. Albedo is the Latin word for whiteness and is also used to describe the reflectance of planetary surfaces. Inside the albedo are carpels made of membranes full of seeds and plump vesicles, usually called pulp. In more primitive types of citrus the vesicles are thin and dry because they are originally derived from hairs. At the center is a stringy structure called the placenta that nourishes the seeds during development. In navel oranges, a second smaller orange develops at the bottom of the fruit like a tiny conjoined twin.

**Cultivation and Fruit Quality**

While many growing conditions can affect the quantity and quality of fruit that a citrus tree bears, phosphorus deficiency is probably the most common malady in fruit that makes it to the grocery store. A tree that is deficient in phosphorus will produce fruits with a thick, bumpy flavedo, thick pith, less sugar, more acid, and less flavor. Limes are especially prone to these poor-quality fruits. When choosing citrus fruits, look for a smooth, fragrant peel and fruits that are firm and heavy for their size (though mandarins tend to be a bit softer than other citrus.) Watch for soft spots or mold, since these can spread quickly.

The bright color of oranges and kumquats only develops when the fruits are exposed to cool temperatures. The climate in California with its hot summers and cool winters is ideal for developing this color and many of our oranges for eating fresh are traditionally grown here. Oranges grown in climates without cool winters may ripen while the peels are still green or yellowish. The FDA allows orange processors to spray oranges with red dye to make the peel brighter. If you‚Äôre using oranges for garnish, oleo-sacchrum, marmalade, or otherwise using the zest, stick to organic oranges or purchase ones grown and packed in California or Arizona, where the use of dye is illegal. Fun historical fact, the color is named for the fruit. Before oranges were introduced to England in the 16th century, people called the color ‚Äúyellow-red.‚Äù

**Cocktail Garnish**

Citrus peel is one of the most popular cocktail garnishes due to its flavor, flexibility, and sturdiness. The channel knife is used to make long, thin strips of citrus peel garnish but it can also be used to cut the outline of larger garnish pieces that are then removed from the fruit with a paring knife. Citrus peel garnishes are often twisted or pinched over the glass to break open the oil glands, spraying a fine mist of fragrant oil over the drink.

Citrus can also be cut into wheels, wedges, knots, flowers, butterflies, or other intricate shapes to perch on a pick or the rim of a glass. A thick quarter-wheel of orange embedded with cloves makes a stunning pomander for hot holiday beverages.

**Oleo-saccharum** 

Oleo-saccharum ‚Äúoil sugar‚Äù is a thick, oily liquid made by mixing the flavedo (zest) of a citrus fruit with sugar. The osmotic pressure of the sugar draws the flavorful oils out of the flavedo so there‚Äôs no need for fancy zesters or a micro grater, the sugar does the work of extracting the essential oils from the glands in the citrus peel.

Ingredients

¬∑ Citrus peels

¬∑ Sugar

Start with fresh, plump citrus fruit; it should be cleaned thoroughly to remove natural and added waxes. Look for thick, smooth skin, to make them easier to peel. Thin, dried-out peel or soft, squishy fruit will make peeling more difficult and more likely to include the bitter pith.

Peel the zest in large strips with a vegetable peeler and place them in a jar or heavy resealable bag with enough sugar to coat the zest pieces (about 1 tablespoon per lime, 3 tablespoons per orange) then seal and shake the jar or bag to coat the zest. To speed the process, use a muddler to bruise the zest. If using a jar, shake periodically to redistribute the sugar, for a bag, knead gently. The zest should soften and turn more translucent as an oily syrup forms from the sugar. To use the syrup, strain it through a mesh strainer or colander and it‚Äôs ready. You can put the peels back in the jar and add a little boiling water to extract any remaining sugar.

Oleo-saccharum can be used as a substitute for simple syrup or combined with the juice of the citrus fruits to make a potent base for lemonade or punch. The high sugar content makes is pretty stable in the refrigerator but a splash of high-proof grain alcohol will keep mold away.

Lemonade/Limeade

Make an oleo-saccharum with zest from 6 large lemons or 10 large limes and one cup of sugar. While that sits (3-24 hours) juice the lemons or limes and refrigerate the juice. Use the smallest container that will hold the juice and seal tightly to keep oxygen out of the juice. Once the peels and sugar are done macerating, add 1/2 cup of hot water and stir it around to dissolve any remaining sugar crystals. Strain through a fine mesh strainer and mix with the juice. This base should be used within a day or frozen because citrus juice oxidizes and changes flavor as it sits. To make lemonade, just add 5 cups of cold water and pour over ice. Sparkling water can used for a fizzy lemonade.

447,cocktails,"Since I don't want to be entirely negative, you don't accomplish a whole with simple dry muddling of herbs.

485,cocktails,Not a cocktail,1584225471
486,cocktails,"It's more a matter of having it taste like the actual herb, instead of the inside of the stem. Chlorophyll tastes the same whether it's mint, sage, basil, whatever, so you're losing the nuance of choosing that particular herb.",1584225271
487,cocktails,"There's any number of ways to completely natural ways to play with color when dealing with cocktail photography. Lighting, contrast, saturation, it's all tweakable in basically any photo editor, a well published book with Photoshop will put a lot of work into making the cocktails look more appetizing, even if it's a bit of a fib.

I've seen a lot of basil gimlets (and served a few) in a lot of bars over the years, the only ones I've seen get that super deep green color were all nitro muddled (basically freezing the herb in liquid nitrogen so you can pulverize it without getting that chlorophyll bitterness). All the others were just a slightly darker Gimlet, but still bright. Cocktails should (imo, but I often dissent with IG driven cocktail culture) be built to taste their best, then aesthetics become a concern.

If you enjoy it, sure go for it, but 99.99% of the time, conventional wisdom is correct and over-muddling can really destroy a bright, fresh cocktail.",1584225175

490,cocktails,"I definitely think it's personal preference and depends on the drink and it's totally unfair to say that ruins it. If you like the drink, you made it right. I do think muddling gently has the goal of getting just the aroma of the plant in the drink while going harder will make it taste much more like chewing on a basil leaf - but then again lots of people really like those grassy, vegetal flavours in something like chartreuse or a hoppy beer (including myself) so who's to say that's a bad thing?",1584224386

In any case, that's the only way I found to make the drink more green. The photo in the book that this recipe is from is even more green than mine, so I imagine they likely just used a food coloring or something.",1584223887

2,cocktails,"But you shouldn't muddle herbs to death... Ever. 

The resulting blast of chlorophyll makes drink exceedingly bitter. If you were muddling until you wrist hurt, you were basically ruining your drink. And slapping them won't contribute anything if you're planning on eviscerating them.",1584223400
3,cocktails,"OK, I'd try this:

1.5 pt VSOP brandy (E&amp;J is a good value option here)  
.5 pt lemon   
.65 pt caffeine-free green or black tea  
.5 pt Half-and-half   
.5 pt whole milk  
.25 to .6 (to taste) orange liqueur (curacao or solerno  
.25 to .6 (to taste) vanilla liqueur (Giffard or Licor 43)  
Salinity to taste

This is based off a Grasshopper riff milk punch I did. The idea was too take a too-sweet dessert-y drink and make a more sophisticated, balanced version. Reserving the liqueur means you can use less and it holds its own, since the flavor of the base punch is so muted.",1584222963
4,cocktails,"Lol, my first two didn't turn out that green either, no worries. By the third one, I realized that I pretty much just had to muddle those poor basil leaves to death. My wrist was pretty tired after each drink.

### Ingredients

* 1 1/2 fl oz Irish Whiskey
* 4 fl oz black coffee (hot, filtered)
* 2 tsp light brown sugar
* 1 fl oz  heavy cream (or whipped cream)
* nutmeg, chocolate shavings, or 2-3 coffee beans (optional, garnish)

### Instructions

* Start with a heat proof cup and some **really good** dark brewed coffee. *\*It is recommended that you add hot water to your cup to warm it prior to mixing your cocktail.*
* Slightly  warm and then aerate your heavy cream by stirring rapidly with a whisk  or fork, or whip heavy cream to a whipped cream consistency. Set aside.
* Remove hot water from your glass. Begin with your brown sugar, add hot coffee and stir.
* Add the Irish Whiskey and stir.
* Pour  aerated heavy whipping cream over the back of a spoon and into your  coffee mug, or dollop whipped cream onto the top of your Irish whiskey  cocktail. Do not use the aerated cans of commercial whipped cream, as  they can ruin your coffee drink.
* Top with optional garnish of nutmeg, shaved chocolate, or 2 - 3 coffee beans if desired.

What's the vodka doing for this cocktail? You may want to consider using a spirit that offers something to the drink other than proof. A really citrus forward gin like Watershed 4 peel or Roku comes to mind. Or potentially the lactic tang you get from pisco could work well here.

Also, you could look at making an orange cordial with oleo and juice to boost the orange flavor, combine with vanilla and potentially use (coconut/) cream to also add the mouthfeel and creaminess to the drink. I think a ramos would be the perfect light, airy creamy cocktail to make an orangesicle drink.

If it were me, I'd try something like:

* 2 dash orange flower water
* .5 Lime
* .5 Lemon
* .75 Orange Cordial
* .5 Vanilla Giffard
* 1.5 Pisco
* 1 Heavy Cream
* Egg White
* Dry/Wet/Strain
* Top Soda or Orange Soda if your bar is cool with stocking that.",1584136391

Sometimes we'll just stuff a jar full of pits straight from the cherries and top it off with 95% ABV.

Harrington‚Äôs is the original version, the Jasmine was invented by Paul Harrington in the mid-1990s

Hess's version is bigger overall, and increases the amount of Campari and Cointreau and decreases the amount of lemon juice. Robert Hess‚Äôs version is both sweeter and much more bitter. The orange liqueur still tones down the Campari, but relatively speaking there's much less lemon juice, and the flavor slips into the background. It's a cocktail that highlights the flavor of the Campari, which can be good or bad depending on your opinion of Campari.

Use as many limes as you like. I‚Äôll typically use 6 at a time. Zest all of them with a micro plane. Then juice them, straining the juice. Measure how much you have.

2 oz of gin and 1/2 to 3/4oz of syrup, stirred with ice and strained make a great Gimlet style drink

Original recipe was in Imbide but theirs called for 2 parts sugar to one part juice. Good if you want to make a lime soda with sparkling water but too sweet IMO for a proper cocktail.

Add crushed ice, flash blend in a drink mixer, open pour. Technically it's supposed to be in a hollowed out pineapple, but uhhh I don't have one of those lying around, so a glass works just as well.

In this case, you could say I used 1/2oz pf puree and 1/2 simple instead of 0 simple and 1oz puree. Despite the PF changes above, it's still heavily dominated by passion fruit flavor.

Do the same with the rest of the jars, with different single herbs or spices. Make them complimentary for the most part, but feel free to get weird with it. 

Then, blend. Try a few drops of different ones in a glass of soda water. Find a blend you like. Ideally, find a few. 

Then, mix those blends in shaker or dropper bottles. 

One weird example - equal parts garlic and hot pepper. use fresh to make the tinctures. Goes well with tequila or mexcal cocktails. 

A less weird one - 3prts cardamom, 2 parts cinnamon, 1 part each star anise and black tea tinctures. Indian Chai bitters.

Add all components to shaker on ice. Shake until chilled. Serve in chilled coupe or martini glass. Garnish with three coffee beans.

120,cocktails,"I live in IL so we recently legalized so it is somewhat ""easy"" to get them. 

Yes Cocktail Chemistry! Love it! First saw the Idea in the Aviary Book, but was discouraged cause how they do it you need some expensive Ice Bath thing. But this was super easy! I just heated up the Drill bit and it went right through! They held together super well and that smash open was worth it!",1584046466
121,cocktails,"What style of drinks are you looking to make? Most of my suggestions would be in the direction of tropical cocktails, but there are some good options for classics as well. 

With that said, my number one recommendation would be making your own orange liqueur. Bitter/Seville oranges and kumquats are in season right now, so it the perfect time for this recipe, which is hands down better than any commercial product I‚Äôve ever tried.

125,cocktails,Ok...,1584045525
126,cocktails,"Nice didn't realize the gummies were edibles as well. What a world we live in now, Where are you that you got ahold of THC Bitters?? I like anywhere from 5-15mg when using edibles myself.   


The ice ball injection turned out well as well. Did you use the method from cocktail chemistry? I tried that a few times and kept screwing it up because melting through the ice was tricky. Now I use a drill with a bit the same size as the meat injector and it turns out way better!",1584045502
127,cocktails,Champagne is made from Chardonnay and Pinot varietals.. what I‚Äôm saying is cheap American blanc de blanc is usually made from the same grapes,1584044982
128,cocktails,Or... make a Penicillin! Enjoying one now :),1584044532
129,cocktails,Is it though? Looks fairly normal to me. Though I am in Europe so this might be different.,1584044509
130,cocktails,"maybe a normal martini but with some quinine (tonic)?

Something like:

\- 2oz Gin

\- 1oz Tonic

\- 1/2oz Dry Vermouth

\- Stir Gin and Vermouth for chill and dilution

\- Add Tonic to mixing glass and give a quick stir just to mix

\- Strain into a chilled coupe

\- Garnish with a lemon twist and cough drop (if you can find a tasty one, maybe a Ricola lol)",1584044325
131,cocktails,great drink. will make one tonight,1584043950
132,cocktails,I had no idea they were a real thing!,1584043923
133,cocktails,Bars and bartenders tend to stick to naming conventions like this so that guests know that the cocktail is similar to another one they may have had. It‚Äôs pretty common.,1584043319

146,cocktails,"The Last Word is gin, maraschino, green chartreuse, and lime juice. I love it deeply but since Naked &amp; famous is just a Last Word variant adapted to the Mezcal I'd try that one first :P",1584040711
147,cocktails,"If you don‚Äôt want to spend so much per drink, Isle of Skye 8 Year is a great blend for mixing. Little bit of peat, little bit of sherry, very tasty all around.",1584040628
148,cocktails,"I always saw videos where Murray Stenson made them with Beefeater; I've made them with Beefeater before, and I think it holds up pretty well.  The gin punches right through the other ingredients.  

Probably an unorthodox choice, but I've found that I also enjoy them made with Valentine Liberator gin; that was how I requested it be made the first time I ever had one, and I enjoyed it.  Valentine has some nice cinnamon notes to it.  The gin doesn't quite punch through as much, though.",1584040608
149,cocktails,Logan berries are a real thing? I thought they were just a weird Buffalo fruit drink flavor,1584040604

157,cocktails,"Add 2 ounces of freezer-temperature Jameson to a chilled highball glass, pour in 6 ounces seltzer for a strong taste, or 6.5 for an easier one.  Add a tiny triangle of grapefruit to the drink, or a lemon peel if you hate grapefruit.

Kudos to Tokyo's Maguchi Kazunari for mastering the original Japanese iceless highball.",1584039940

161,cocktails,"ah, thanks for the clarification.",1584039134
162,cocktails,My favorite cocktail and always my Friday after work ritual. I prefer Plymouth gin to a London Dry. Would love to hear about other gin options.,1584038553

164,cocktails,"How do you know the blackberry isn't the hybrid? Being more commonly known doesn't make it ""the original"".",1584038106
165,cocktails,"Agave *nectar* is much sweeter, yes. Agave syrup, which is the nectar blended 1:1 with water to make it more easily pourable and to keep it from clumping up in the cold environment of a cocktail shaker, is not much different.",1584037984
166,cocktails,I thought a dirty Shirley was made with vodka? Is it just any type of spirit thrown in?,1584037531
167,cocktails,Super simple but a Oaxacan Old Fashioned is really excellent and will really let the Mezcal shine.,1584036726
168,cocktails,"Huh, I didn't know that there were so many variations to a margarita. We have most of the extra ingredients here. I'm probably going to start with just a classic margarita, and then we'll go from there. It's a long weekend. Thanks!",1584036274
169,cocktails,Cherries are stone fruits. Like a peach or apricot.,1584035993
170,cocktails,"Agave syrup is MUCH sweeter than simple syrup, so start with a smaller amount.",1584035662
171,cocktails,nice thing about Espolon is that the Blanco and Reposado cost basically the same. You can always try the other later.,1584035633
172,cocktails,"Just wanted to give my 2 cents here. After trying many different variants and ratios. If you are using a quality tequila I‚Äôve come around to ditching the orange liqueur and doing the Tommy‚Äôs margarita variant.

2 oz tequila 
1 oz lime juice
0.25 - 0.5 oz agave syrup 

I find it is more tasty and if you really appreciate the taste of tequila it will come out more.",1584035526
173,cocktails,are you using Luxardo maraschino or Luxardo sangue morrelaco?,1584035231
174,cocktails,I saw one as well that had lavender bitters and tequila.  I can't remember the name of that one though,1584035020
175,cocktails,"Well,that's why I made a joke about it lol",1584034983
176,cocktails,The shelf full of Plymouth was kind of a giveaway in this case.,1584034929
177,cocktails,"It's (no pun intended) a muddled category. A quick google search shows both names with any number of variations and modifications (LPU with pineapple, LoTO with serrano ... both with tequila [which makes even less sense in the case of LoTO but it's out there]). As well as both as simply Mezcal Last Words (which quite frankly, is just what we should call the drink).",1584034880

185,cocktails,"In all honesty they don't taste all that great either, they aren't *bad* but not anything to write home about either. haha",1584032260
186,cocktails,"If you are just going for a good margarita, then you've lined up good choices and I'm sure she'll be happy with any direction.  As you've heard, the biggest pieces are 100% agave tequila and fresh limes.  The rest is all preference of what experience you are going for.  The ratio's of what you use will also come into play.  There's the heavier tequila ones or all the way to 1/1/1 (1 oz of each tequila, cointreau/grand mariner, lime) and with/without agave/simple syrup.  

One I'm going to try when I track down the ingredients and ambition is Fortaleza Reposado tequila and key limes.  The guy telling me about was so passionate about it that I need to try it, but I haven't found that brand around me (his wife picks it up on business trips to Arizona) and juicing key limes is a lot of effort.  He said he loves using Reposado tequila for some extra depth and varies up the types of limes to make a more noticeable difference.",1584032085
187,cocktails,This is a very good answer,1584032082

190,cocktails,I'm too America centric figured it was mass,1584031627
191,cocktails,"they're two different drinks, both based on the last word. 


The last of the Oaxacans is a last word with mezcal instead of gin. 


La Ultimata Palabra is the same but with pineapple juice added in addition to lime.",1584031551
192,cocktails,"I tried Meletti at first, but Nonino's burned orange peel and vanilla really brings this together. I'm hoping by the time I get to revision 10 it's a drink I'm comfortable making for friends",1584031414
193,cocktails,"I used a London dry, I could see it working with a floral though.",1584031315
194,cocktails,"Go for,it. I really like this mix,though, good combo, I might try it with drambuie and coffee tincture instead or coffee liquor, I dont usually keep any! 

I gotta use meletti or Montenegro, nonino isn't available in my state",1584031308

200,cocktails,"This is a pretty classical recipe and for me it is just right every time.

1 part fresh squeezed lime juice
1 part Cointreau
2 part Tequila

If I have Anejo, I use Anejo Tequila, it adds a bit of complexity.",1584030961

203,cocktails,"B10 is 45%, the imperial proof is 57%. The scotch I used is 63%, but it's a single cask IB, so finding another one is impossible.

When I said hot, I meant in terms of alcohol burn. 45% is just too alcohol-forward to be relaxing/cozy",1584030674
204,cocktails,"Gotcha, The only other choices I had on hand were 5oz coupes or 6oz martini glasses, and my hands shake a bit, so I like leaving a bit of extra room in the glass.",1584030612
205,cocktails,"I disagree, considering b10 is what 57%? It's plenty enjoyable. I hate hot cockgtails, but room temp drinks can be pretty cool. But this is all just imo",1584030547

.75 Cynar

.75 Mezcal",1584030221
208,cocktails,"Aperol and Mezcal go together like peanut butter and jelly. Yes Campari will be good, but Aperol will always be better in my book.",1584030092
209,cocktails,What glass would you use?,1584030079
210,cocktails,"I thought about room temp, but back of the napkin math puts the cocktail at ~45% ABV before dilution, and that's just too hot to be enjoyable.",1584030071
211,cocktails,"I wanted dilution and wasn't thinking. In hindsight, stirring is probably better.",1584030040
212,cocktails,"Not much, to be honest. Agave syrup just feels more fitting since tequila is an agave spirit. Simple syrup works just fine.",1584029792
213,cocktails,That's cool. Nice looking bar. Where I'm from distillery bars can't serve others products,1584029753
214,cocktails,"Oh haha, never been there.",1584029647
215,cocktails,"I bet your bar holds the last word in naming cocktails, 'cause it matters so much in this case.",1584029474

222,cocktails,How do you infuse the gin,1584028516
223,cocktails,"We've just always called it La Ultima Palabra ... Because that makes sense and is very clear what it is. 

""Last of the Oaxacans,"" is a cheeky name (and no doubt 700 cocktails bars have had some random mezcal drink with this name), but doesn't really communicate what the drink is effectively.",1584028348
224,cocktails,This doesn't look too sweet to me: it uses bitterness (Campari and orange bitters) rather than acid to balance the sweetness. On paper it looks balanced.,1584028269
225,cocktails,Holy shit that is cool,1584028140
226,cocktails,"I think the [Ready, Fire, Aim](https://www.liquor.com/recipes/ready-fire-aim/) is the most approachable mezcal cocktail.",1584028007
227,cocktails,"You're exactly right, and this is the curse of milk punches: the stripping effect removes most of the phenolic compounds, and one big class of phenolic compounds is flavonoids. That is, flavor compounds.

What I do is reserve already clear ingredients (usually liqueurs, hydrosols, tinctures, flavored syrups) and add them to the finished punch. I call it reflavoring‚Äînot a very clever name, but it works. One word of caution: Don't reflavor with liquor-proof spirits, as they'll overpower the drink and ruin the mellow finish with an ethanol bite. I don't add back any ingredients stronger than liqueurs.",1584027953
228,cocktails,"Such an interesting cocktail. The first half of the recipe look like a classic stirred drink, then the tiki ingredients show up ready to party.",1584027925
229,cocktails,"I was talking myself into the reposado because I normally like aged liquors more, but I sort of indirectly asked her about her preference and got Blanco as an answer, so that's what I'll be getting.

And I completely hear everyone on the fresh limes. Thank you!",1584027772
230,cocktails,"London dry, especially something navy strength. You need a lot to stand up to everything else going on. Perry's tot or Edinburgh cannonball are my faves.

236,cocktails,Haha word.,1584026109

238,cocktails,"Beautiful photo! Two of my favorite variations that I would highly recommend are:

*Naked and Famous*

3/4 oz Mezcal 

3/4 oz Aperol

3/4 oz Yellow chartreuse

3/4 oz Lime juice

I‚Äôve had it with both yellow and green chartreuse and I can‚Äôt really notice a difference so I think you can get by with either one. 

*Paper Plane*

3/4 oz bourbon 

3/4 oz Aperol

3/4 oz amaro nonino

3/4 oz lemon juice",1584025842

I lost some foam because i changed the glass.",1584025753
241,cocktails,"It s masala, sorry",1584025595
242,cocktails,Yeah. I'd probably use a wild Turkey or buffalo trace in this. Great classic bourbons but nothing that's either gona break the bank or get lost in the sauce.,1584025368
243,cocktails,"I just want to say that this community is great.

Thank you all for being so helpful!",1584025094
244,cocktails,Would you use a London dry gin or something with more floral notes with this cocktail?,1584025063
245,cocktails,No doubt! Im always heavy handed with bitters. Makes everything taste/smell better.,1584024769
246,cocktails,Nope. The foam on top is from shaken pineapple juice.,1584024593
247,cocktails,Sounds awesome! Don't have any grapefruit bitters unfortunately,1584024449
248,cocktails,"It's a dropper and nowhere near as strong as the chocolate for some reason.

Based on one of my cocktail books, 10 drops = 1 dash (because there's no consistency in what a ""dash"" means, the author came up with a few measures to try to create some consistency).

Surprisingly, the coffee infusion actually sweetened the rye, IMO. Not as bitter as I will have expected. Took the heat down on it too.

Now I have whiskey soaked espresso beans that I'm debating making coffee from. They shriveled up a lot after they dried... No idea if I can do anything with them.",1584024375
249,cocktails,"That black tea port punch is very low abv if you do the math. Maybe just try a recipe that has a bit more booze in it. If it's watery, you might want to add a bit more sugar. Also try ingredients with strong flavors that will cut through, e.g. Smith and Cross or other high ester funky rums.",1584023540

266,cocktails,"More gin less midori, lol",1584021009

Reposado vs. blanco doesn't make that much of a difference, but more of the Tequila flavor will usually come through with a blanco. What's more important is your recipe. Does she like them a little on the sweeter side or does she like them pretty tart? That will affect how much (if any) simple or agave syrup you use to balance the acidity. 

You can start with 2 oz. Tequila, 3/4 oz. lime and 3/4 oz. Cointreau. Then add anywhere from 1 tsp. of sweetener (simple or agave) to 1/4 oz. 

Buy good quality limes and juice them fresh. When buying limes, try to go with the ones that feel heavy for their size. They will be the juiciest.

Shake with fresh ice. Not the ice that's been sitting in your freezer for the last six months. And if you're serving it in a cocktail glass (i.e. not on the rocks), don't forget to chill your glass in the freezer for a few minutes beforehand.",1584003636

Agave is a [high fructose sweetener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agave_syrup).

""**Agave syrup**, commonly though inaccurately known as **agave nectar(1)**, is a sweetener commercially produced from several species of agave, including *Agave tequilana* (blue agave)"" ""Having fructose as its primary sugar, blue-agave syrup (56% fructose) is similar in fructose content to high-fructose corn syrup (55% fructose content), the most common sweetener used in US manufactured beverages.""

Replacing it with Curacao or Triple Sec might be interesting, but the flavor profile of agave isn't anything like orange.  Plus, with only a barspoon of the syrup/nectar, the last words anybody would use to describe the flavor profile of this cocktail is ""too sweet"".  

Those bitters look good but, technically, they're not mole¬¥ bitters either.  Mole¬¥ is a Mexican sauce made with chocolate and spices, so with only chocolate and vanilla they're probably not exactly what the recipe called for either.

497,cocktails,"Draft cocktails are best used by super-high volume establishments.  I repurposed old premix soda stations back in '03 &amp; '04 for cocktail service.  It was a beach bar, in a resort town with a proper stage for live acts and 1200 capacity.  We did $25-50k/day with 5 bartenders max at any one time.

I recommend you only serve stirred cocktails on draft unless you empty your corny kegs nightly.  Anything made with fruit juices (Margaritas, Daiquiris, etc) needs the kegs to be well agitated on a regular basis because of the tendency for separation.  Our barbacks found agitating the kegs well every 30 minutes prevented any issues.  These lines also tend to need to be flushed nightly because of the organic (from the juices) and high sugar contents.  This is especially true if you don't have refrigerated lines.

The other issues is getting the balance of N2O and CO2 right.  Shaken cocktails not pushed with a bit of CO2 (and a majority of N2O) will still need to be shaken once out of the tap or they will taste ""flat"".  This ratio of N2O and CO2 may vary from cocktail to cocktail.  I have not been successful with my, admittedly, minor efforts to mix the gas on site and have ordered the gas cylinders filled at the right ratio.  I have also seen N2O cylinders abused by staff.  Laughing gas can really be no laughing matter.

I currently have an Italian Restaurant client, for which I built a 2-tap cocktail station with Negronis and Boulevardiers, both pushed with N2O.  They go through at least a half-corny keg a night of each.  It is mostly for the ""theater"" of it all.  I can mix individual cocktails almost as fast as I can pour them.  But if an order for six comes through, the taps are definitely faster.  During the Summer, they switch out the Boulevardiers with Americanos (pushed with a high ratio of CO2).  I haven't found a way to keeps Sbagliatos for any length of time either.  The prosecco gets weird after 18 hours or so.

The final issue is the lifespan of citrus juices.  You really don't want them hanging around more than 24 hours anyway.  Trust me.  You can taste the difference.  Draft Margaritas taste much brighter when fresh as opposed to 2-days old.  However, maybe your customers wouldn't care.  You can look to clarifying your juices or using acid replacements.  Is it all really worth the trouble?

I suggest you consider batching your cocktails rather than putting them on draft.  It can speed up service immensely without the hassle and added expense of a complete draft system.  Your cheaters can be shaken with each use, nullifying the need to keep kegs well agitated.  If you truly have a high volume situation, you can have gallon jugs (or more cheaters) as backup in your lowboy.

Just my 2¬¢.  Maybe someone else will come along with an opposing viewpoint.

499,cocktails,"Adding sourness to a sweet drink would be described as balancing the drink not making it drier. Dryness is the absense of sugar, very different thing.

As for the initial queury, what is balancing the drink here is some bitterness and percentage of alcohol. You may infact be correct that is too sweet as it does seem a little high in sugar content (My guess is .25 oz of each would better) but its hard to say just looking at the specs and not having tasted the syrups. Maybe OP could enlighten us as to the ratio of the syrups.

95,cocktails,"**Please see imgur album for full tutorial.**

I am sure many of you have seen the Flavour Blaster, a very cool device that allows you to create vapor-filled bubbles, but it is unfortunately out of price range for most home bartenders. We should figure out how to make our own economically at home so that we can spend the savings on other things.

**The first step is to figure out how to make an edible bubble.** There is a commercial product called BubbleLick, reviews are okay but it is not available in my country. It looks a bit pricey too. Flavour Blaster has a proprietary solution but the shipping is just not feasible for me. Aliexpress has it's own unlabeled solution for sale around 20$ but I did not want to purchase a food product from their site. Reviewing the BubbleLick ingredients, it is quite clear that it is literally soap, so there must be a way to eat soap. Thankfully (?) there is. After trying many soaps that labels had them as reasonable for consumption in low doses, the 7th generation unscented dish soap is really neutral, even when the bubble is made over water you cannot taste it when drinking the water after!

**The second step is the bubble gun,** this is clearly using the technique of the vape pens, with a heating coil that vaporizes vegetable glycerin. So we need a way to use a vape pen in reverse, instead of inhaling the smoke it should be blown out. By redirecting the air flow through a chamber around the pen you can reverse the air flow and produce a vapor cloud. Thankfully someone figured this out for me (see video link).

**This opens so many new solutions**, for one, this cost me about 50$ USD to make (cost of soap and vaporizing device, believe it or not I had everything else on hand). You can make your own vaporizing liquids that **expand the flavors to a near unlimited array and for very feasible prices for experimentation.**

*For those not ready to jump into the idea, start by using your Smoking Gun to create wood-smoke filled bubbles, this is the most easy experiment to begin with.*

Lastly, this post is not an endorsement of smoking or vaping. The smoke/vapor is for the cocktail. Please consume at your own risk and follow local health guidelines and general health precautions. Large quantities of smoke and soap are obviously not safe.

**Neutral Bubble Liquid**

* 500g water
* 0.7g-1g guar gum
* 20g unscented 7th generation dish soap (or similar nontoxic unscented dish soap)
* 1g baking powder

Blend all ingredients until smooth. Strain foam and use chamber vacuum sealer to faciliate bursting the remaining bubbles. Strain again. Let mixture settle. This makes a very large quantity, you will not need more.

*Alternatively, combine soap and guar gum and gently whisk until smooth. Slowly add the water to create a homogenous mixture, being careful to not introduce too much air. Stir in baking powder. Remove any large bubbles and let mixture settle.*

**Troubleshooting the bubbles:**

The physiology of the bubbles is quite complex and I have not read into it much. Likely this recipe could be more optimized; my guar gum is very old and my scale is only accurate to a tenth of a gram. Apparently adding more soap and guar gum does not necessarily make stronger bubbles.

**Using the recipe to create cold wood-smoke filled bubbles:**

With a cold smoke machine, such as the Polyscience smoking gun, set up as per manufacturers recommendations. Ignite wood chips. Quickly, with the machine running, dip end of tube into bubble mixture. Create bubble over wet-rimmed cocktail glass.

**For vapor-filled bubbles:**

With a tubular e-cigarette device, follow the instructions in this video for modification ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hClu-az7qjQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hClu-az7qjQ)). I use a bubble tea straw without holes poked in the end. I have this near-flush with the mouthpiece of the e-cigarette. I found this allowed me to create more smoke. A laminated piece of laminating paper made a nice flexible tube for the device.

Set up device as per manufacturers recommendations, with your desired liquid. Turn on device. Dip straw end in bubble mixture. Blow on other end of device to create vapor bubbles. You will need to experiment with this. I found that once the bubble tea straw was used a bunch it created more fragile bubbles. As well, it was easier to create a bubble when holding the device parallel or perpendicular to the floor. Ideally, use a separate coil and atomizing chamber for each flavor.

**Future goals:**

TL;DR In BC Tofino's is unique, being amber, not green, and made in the classic French style. Get a bottle ASAP --- it works great in cocktails or as a sipper.

The best way to describe Tofino's absinthe in my opinion is traditional, French-style absinthe (aka 'absinthe ambre') meticulously executed. It opens with that big anise flavour backed by wormwood for a nice full taste, and then trails off through wormwood into subtle botanicals, mostly in the 'herb' palette but with a touch of floral sweetness. Because it's such a classic profile, it's my go-to first absinthe for cocktails --- I have Baba Yaga (Arbutus) and Taboo (Okanagan Spirits) on the bar right now, but they're usually something I pull out when I'm playing around, as opposed to  a first-line mixing absinthe.

Baba Yaga I find is mintier with less anise flavour, and is, of course, an 'absinthe verte'.

The Devil's Club (Pemberton's absinthe) I find is earthier, with more wormwood emphasis. It is, again, an 'absinthe verte'  It mixes really nice with gin, in my opinion, and I actually make a variation on this that I call the John Milton using Devil's Club.

Because I mentioned it, Taboo is the lightest absinthe of three, almost a 'blanc' style, despite being 'verte'. It's fun to louche --- it louches up fast with a dramatic colour change. A great summer sipper.",1583951491

So you can steep anything there, even ants! Hell, you could steep a human in there and make a human gin if you wanted. lmao

They could work for you. Basically, you start with scotch and vermouth and add something, either Benedectine, absinthe, or drambuie. Different scotch will also change the drink, just like switching gin in an aviation. 

You could do:

* Robert Burns: 2 Scotch,  3/4 Vermouth, dash of absinthe and orange bitters. (Waldorf)
* Robbie Burns:  2 Scotch,  3/4 Vermouth, 3/4 ounce Benedictine  (Savoy/Cradock)
* Bobby Burns: 2 Scotch,  3/4 Vermouth, 1/4 Drambuie, dash Peychaud's (Embury)

Dried spices and most dried flowers do fine with those temperatures, higher temperature extracts the flavor faster, and warmer water will dissolve the sugar more readily when you get to that part.

I should note this works fine for 1:1 syrups but it can be difficult to fully dissolve the sugar for ratio of sugar to water near 2:1. In that case, you might need to apply additional heat.

I almost never boil water and sugar together on the stove because some water evaporates so your ratio gets thrown off. Adding

I might do a lower temperature if I‚Äôm concerned it‚Äôs a particularly delicate herb like fresh mint.

Widely know to be created when Mrs Calabrese insisted that Salvatore eat breakfast, offering him marmalade on toast. Though Salvatore only ever wanted his morning coffee, which is as he himself describes as, ‚Äúvery Italian‚Äù. 

Honouring Salvatore‚Äôs Italian heritage was important when creating my cocktail. So i‚Äôve drawn inspiration from another classic Italian product, the amaro spritz, a combination of a bitter sweet Italian liqueur and prosecco.

The traditional orange marmalade is replaced by my ‚Äòamarolade‚Äô a marmalade made to replicate the bitter-sweet flavours of Italian amaro.   

The acidity of the drink comes from a ‚ÄòProsecco Shrub‚Äô, made from prosecco vinegar, Amalfi lemons &amp; chamomile. Prosecco vinegar, adds acidity, but also the classic dryness of prosecco. The addition of Amalfi lemons, adds amazing citrus flavour and also nods to Salvatore‚Äôs home town.

Also, there's the [baked apple cocktail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnmEua8FKi0) (which in the video is presented as Fallout-themed but the actual cocktail would fit 100% as a LotR drink imo) and the [Skyrim cocktails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAKSf6IznTc) (though the intresting ones in that video contain some hard-to-get liqeurs?)

Idk if there are any classics that stand out. Bee's Knees is honey and gin and lemon which feels like it fits The Aesthetic, but it's also a fairly simple drink that's shaken, maybe make it as a long drink with some soda water(nevermind, I guess regular water would be better :P) and garnish with rosemary or something? There's also the Penicillin which is a short drink but just fits so well with ginger, lemon, scottish whisky, and honey: just making it a long drink with a fitting herb garnish would probably be swell too. Idk, I'd think more about it but I really need to go to bed and hour-long cocktail deep-dives and brainstorming is just the thing that keeps me up at night haha

But I would if I was to create something myself probably try to do something containing something like vermouth(herbal wine? sounds LotR as fuck haha), gin/jenever, chartreuse, honey, whisk(e)y, just in general anything with fresh herbs in it or as a garnish, and/or something with spice or tea syrups, but like I said I'm not going to spit out an original recipe or do more research than that rn.

Also side note, I don't have a recommendation for a mead brand but look for the ones that are high proof and not carbonated.

440,cocktails,"When I was researching rum punch recipes after returning from Jamaica, I found that a lot of them used strawberry syrup.

Pomegranate and passion fruit syrups were also very common. For juices the most common ones were pineapple. orange, and a sour citrus like lemon or lime. A few of the recipes included a small amount of ginger beer (like a quarter ounce). But none of them used ginger syrup or muddled ginger.

I know for a fact that both the tour drinks contain a ton of Angostura bitters (seriously, the dark and stormy had like 10 or 15 dashes in it). I watched them make the drinks and the juices etc... were not labeled, but it's nearly impossible to miss that much Ago bitters being used a few feet from your nose.

We stayed at Sunset at the Palms, and they had a very good run punch as well. Here is the recipe for that.

‚Ä¢ 1 Cup lime or lemon juice

‚Ä¢ 2 cups strawberry flavored syrup (or other simple red colored syrup)

34,cocktails,"Hey just to follow up about mint. I‚Äôve been in Hanoi for the last month with my bar roll and have been taking full advantage of the cheap Havana Club rum and local mint. Obviously my partner and I have been imbibing many mojitos so I did a little experiment. 

I gently muddled my mint with my syrup in the tin, built the rest of it, did a dry whip shake, then strained the mint from the drink. I set the mint aside and finished the mojito which ended up great with plenty of mint oil extracted from dry shake. I then steeped the leftover partially extracted mint in some local Vietnamese vodka along with some fresh mint leaves from my bundle. I then used the rest of my fresh mint to make a mint simple syrup before it went bad. 

After straining the mint from the vodka, I cut the mint infused vodka with the mint syrup (proofed down to 25% abv) to make creme de menthe. Turns out homemade creme de menthe is awesome! 

Additionally, I had leftover mint syrup which was used in future mojitos to really amplify the mint with the dry shake technique.",1583821784

42,cocktails,"Thanks for the follow! I haven't officially launched it yet, just making sure things are running properly, but I wanted to make sure there was a fair amount of content to start with. Starting in a couple of weeks there will be weekly posts starting with the rest of my vermouth guides.

As for Taipei, the scene there is fantastic! I was working at a spot called Ounce (#30 Asia's 50, 2016) which goes heavy on the Taipei X NYC vibe, drawing inspiration primarily from NYC bars like Milk &amp; Honey, PDT, Death &amp; Co. etc. Draft Land is fantastic, but the real treat is the cocktail bar above it called The Testing Room which had some of the best drinks I've had in a long while anywhere. Bar Ron was phenomenal - their program is based on various baijiu and they easily have the most successful and downright delicious baijiu cocktails I've ever had (honestly, that bar puts an end to the debate as to whether or not good baijiu cocktails exist). Indulge Experimental Bistro and Aha Saloon are deserved of their spots on the World's 50 list. 

Two standouts for me are both in their soft opening phase: To Infinity and Beyond has a wildly inventive menu and the space feels like if the Citadel from Mass Effect had a cocktail bar haha. The other spot was The Room by Le Kief which is the most avant garde experience in the city and very much felt like a more dialed in Aviary/Existing Conditions. Washu is a Japanese cocktail bar that takes the Mace concept of focusing on a single botanical, but takes an elegant, streamlined, decidedly Japanese approach. Washu +1 is next door and does a series of tasting menus based on various botanicals and foods and had some super interesting drinks. Bar Mood and Bar Mu are also amazing. I did a pop-up at Meowvelous Club Boys Saloon (#49 Asia's 50, 2017) a year and a half ago and that place is mandatory as well.

So yeah, Taipei has one of the most slept on cocktail cultures in the world. It's young, but has grown very fast. It's a very interesting balance of Japanese and American style cocktail cultures with most of the bars finding a way to imprint a uniquely Taiwanese twist to their programs. The above list just scratches the surface.",1583818696

*Recipe By:* Steve Cutchen

*Summary:* 

This is a riff on a Negroni meant to lighten and brighten the drink. Made with Old Tom gin, it is otherwise a cross between a [Contessa](https://www.saveur.com/article/recipes/contessa-aperol-cocktail/) (gin, dry vermouth, Aperol) and a traditional Negroni. The result is Old Tom with a 50:50 amaro and a 50:50 perfect vermouth split, both in the lighter direction. This is a Negroni variant that goes great pool-side.

*Ingredients:*

* 1 ounce Old Tom gin
* 1/2 ounce dry vermouth
* 1/2 ounce sweet vermouth
* 1/2 ounce Campari
* 1/2 ounce Aperol

*Directions:*

Stir ingredients in an iced mix glass 30 rounds. Strain into a rocks glass with fresh ice.",1583774799

287,cocktails,"Hi! I'm that bartender from Pouring Ribbons! I remember having this conversation actually haha.

I was one of the managers there in 2015/2016 and one of the SRO bartenders. I left a bit before the big renovation of SRO and before the rest of the management/staff turned over. My understanding is the original owners sold the place so it's an entirely new team behind the spot. I haven't revisited, but when I've been in SF I've walked by and can tell by the menu posted on the Mission St. window that its a totally different program. 

The former GM who was responsible for 85% of the menus is now at the Kabuki hotel bar. The other manager I worked with moved to NYC around when I did, and the other crucial piece of the SRO puzzle opened his own spot called Fogeater Cafe in Mendocino. The most solid bartender we had at the time opened a spot in Roanoke, VA called River and Rail.

Anyway, if you're looking for something in SF to echo your NYC and Tokyo experiences, I don't think you'll quite find it. It's definitely a different drinking city with a very different drinking culture. Bourbon and Branch as well as Wilson and Wilson are good, but stuffy in an almost uninviting way. I do love White Chapel, but as you pointed out, it's obviously gin-focused (though their house Gimlet made with Moletto Tomato gin warrants a visit whenever I'm in town). ABV is probably my favorite bar in the city, but it may not scratch your itch. Pacific Cocktail Haven is a close second and may be closer to what you're looking for. Both bars are pretty laid back. Best tiki bar in the city is Pagan Idol IMO. Bar Agricole is my favorite place in all of SF and the cocktails are phenomenal (Trou Normand is another excellent choice). Benjamin Cooper was super badass for a couple years, but the last few times I've been I've felt the cocktails were schizophrenic at best (this could have changed as its been well over a year since my last visit). Local Edition does classics and classic-inspired drinks quite well. Trick Dog's menu drinks are always awesome enough that I've never gone off menu, but its also the only bar I've ever been to that I'd describe as too busy to enjoy (go early maybe?)

I've heard great things about True Laurel, but haven't made it yet. Hope that helps!",1583742096

It‚Äôs hard to expect something special from a bar at a ski resort. 

Believe me or not, I‚Äôve just found a hidden gem: perfect speakeasy (I¬†mean, it‚Äôs almost NYC-level bar) at the less expected place to find something like that: South Lake Tahoe. It‚Äôs Community Speakeasy, highly recommend. It‚Äôs not easy to find: look for the back door at Social House Craft Sandwiches.

Here‚Äôs a cocktail I enjoyed as much, so I tried to reverse-engineering it.

They called to Xicaru Mezcal and Cazadores Anejo Tequila. I didn‚Äôt have them, so I used Del Maguey Vida and Olmeca Altos Reposado instead.

My first try was ¬æ Cynar, ¬Ω Vermouth, ¬Ω Amaro Averna, and it wasn‚Äôt good: too bitter and straightforward.

If I were to make this again, I would up the heering slightly and bring down the Campari, probably do a 0.75-0.75 mix of both.

9,cocktails,"I recently picked up the two most called for banana liqueurs, **Giffard's Banane du Bresil** and **Tempus Fugit's Creme de Banane**, and figured I'd share some thoughts below.

**Tasting notes:**

* **Banane du Bresil:** Banana candy (like Runts), sweet-ish (but not overly sweet); oily texture
* **Creme de Banane:** Banana bread, baking spices, warm and quite sweet; almost syrupy in texture, much thicker than the Banane du Bresil, close to PX sherry. My fiancee commented that she wanted to pour this all over ice cream and sip it as an aperitif.

**Use in Cocktails:**

I tried both of these in various cocktails, includin¬†/u/CNHPhoto's Banana Farmer, [Stayton's Secret](https://www.alcoholprofessor.com/blog-posts/inside-the-bar-frank-caiafa-at-the-stayton-room), [Banana Bliss](https://punchdrink.com/recipes/banana-bliss/), Banana Daiquiri, and the [Bananavardier 3.0](https://punchdrink.com/recipes/bananavardier-3-0/).

In all of these, my fiancee and I preferred the Tempus Fugit Creme de Banane. The Banane du Bresil brought a very salient banana candy taste to each of the cocktails. It made its presence known, and in this case, I didn't think that was a good thing - I personally don't feel like the banana candy taste complements the cocktails I used it in very well. However, the Creme de Banane was quite different - its flavors seemed to blend into other cocktails in a mellower way.

Case in point: I thought the Bananavardier 3.0 with the Banane du Bresil was awful (even though Banane du Bresil is what's called for), whereas it was quite delicious with the Tempus Fugit.

However, that's just me! For those of you who have tried both, are there any situations in which you like the candy-like taste of the Giffard over the Tempus Fugit?",1583700672

42,cocktails,"Most ""tobacco bitters"" generally don't contain tobacco. It's usually based on things like Lapsang Souchang tea. Tobacco is not listed as an approved ingredient for food products by the FDA. Ingesting tobacco injects WAAAYYYYYY more nicotine than smoking (like 20x), and small amounts (say, half a cigar infused in a bottle of whiskey) are enough to make a majority of guests nauseous. Several drinks could actually be deadly.

I draw my absolute line at smoking a glass. Anything beyond that is actively endangering people.

Here's a great read on the subject:

64,cocktails,"Well its just that your only comment on her was on her looks, not her skills. There are no posts about male bartenders here that are ""oh he's so cute"" "" he's such a sweetheart"". They are evaluated by their skills, not their looks. But an attractive lady is bartending and suddenly ""how cute"" ""how sweet"" but not, ""wow she knows her stuff"". It's just sort of humiliating to be evaluated first for your looks and second for your actual job skills.

If a company CEO was delivering an address to their employees you wouldn't say ""how cute""

I'm probably being oversensitive but I have been in the industry a long time and female bartenders still play second fiddle to male bartenders.

Any combination of spirit, sweetener, bitters, water (melt). For example:

**Mother's Bane**

*Old Tom gin was called Mother's Ruin because of its effect on families and the birth rate. It was the cheapest and most easily obtained strong liquor. Old Tom gin is, in fact, the English old-fashioned liquor. So it seemed appropriate that a Mother‚Äôs Ruin-based version of an Old Fashioned cocktail would be named based on that old epithet for the spirit itself; thus Mother‚Äôs Bane.*

*This Gin Old Fashioned uses Campari as the bitters, with a nod to the Negroni gods. I stick with simple syrup to stay out of the way of the well known symbiotic nuances of the gin and Campari marriage.*

* **2** teaspoons simple syrup

In fact, this is the summary I wrote for it:

*This is an ‚ÄúImproved Bourbon Cocktail.‚Äù In 1876, an updated edition of Jerry Thomas‚Äô Bar-Tender‚Äôs Guide included an appendix with ‚ÄúImproved‚Äù versions of the long-standard brandy, whiskey and gin Old Fashioned cocktail recipes (spirit, sugar, bitters and ice or water), adding other ingredients, such as maraschino liqueur and absinthe. This class of cocktails was known as ‚ÄúImproved Cocktails.‚Äù It never took off as a full-fledged cocktail category. But it did birth an era of experimentation and nomenclature in the late 19th century, and subtle variations on a theme would prompt a bartender to note the changes, often with new names. There were lots of variations‚Äîlike using brandy instead of gin in a mix of lemon and Cointreau‚Äîbut new names were spawned; nobody calls the ‚ÄòSidecar‚Äô the ‚ÄòImproved White Lady.‚Äô*

*This bourbon Improved Cocktail with maraschino, absinthe (for me, Herbsaint), and Peychaud‚Äôs bitters modifying a Bourbon Old Fashioned looks like a bourbon riff on a Sazerac, so that‚Äôs how I am naming it. Even though the preparation and presentation is different.*",1583689291

On the Punt e Mes:

*With a kick of bitter china (KEY-nah), Punt e Mes can play two roles in a cocktail, adding both sweetness and bitterness ‚Äî a handy multitasker when making so-called brown-and-stirred drinks, which generally feature aged spirits, bitters, and something to sweeten the two.*",1583688475
123,cocktails,I haven't heard of those before. I was thinking of the Admiral Rodney and 1931 which are all incredible. St Lucia Distillers has one hell of a large portfolio.,1583688472

125,cocktails,"I think its got enough going on that it will survive. Not how i would serve it, but not as egregious as serving say, a daiquiri on the rocks, which imo would water it down to much for the flavor of the cocktail

131,cocktails,"Yeah punt e mes is very aggressive, and needs to be tempered, and ia certainly not an all purpose vermouth. I don't even really think of it as vermouth in the recipe part of my brain, it's its own thing 

I totally agree about carpano. Its expensive and fancy looking so people assume its the best. Its great! I love it, but it's not the best, period, and it's definitely not the best for a lot of cocktails. 

Its technically a vermouth ala vaniglia,  subset of vermouth with a strong vanilla forward taste, and it is quite sweet. Some drinks need a little bit more tart and red fruit, like cocchi do torino, or a more ""savory"" herbal pop like you get from dolin rouge. Personally, I think cocchi is far more all purpose than carpano antica. 

And your totally right, for some drinks i want a bold, higb proof whiskey. But for something like a paper plane, I want something lighter, mixable, but still great tasting, like bufftrace.",1583687843
132,cocktails,"You might only have one distillery, but it puts out some damn fine rum!",1583687771
133,cocktails,"I'm glad someone else finally said it. 

I all too often see Punt e Mes being used where something like Cocchi Torino or Dolin would be way better from a balance perspective. 

Then again, it's kinda like the whiskey equivalent of proof whoring, I think people naturally in their cocktail journey just kind of equate ""big &amp; bold"" as being better (i.e. everyone claiming Antica is the best vermouth ever hands down. It's great when applied well, it's often a bully though.) 

I often tell people once they've continued learning a little bit to go back and try those 90 proof bottlings and more gentle vermouths, and they're often surprised at how much more nuance they can pick up after spending a year or two down the ""Everything high proof and with the richest flavors you can find"" rabbit hole.",1583687392

141,cocktails,"Hey fair enough, but to me that cocktail is still,just a Manhattan cocktail, pretty similar to Jerry's 1887 recipe. Except for the ratio, which you are righg about. 

 I guess some people consider punt e mes a vermouth but its really a bottled mixed drink. Essentially vermouth and bitters/amaro mixed together, and is quite a bit more bitter than just about any vermouth I can think of. Hence the name punt e mes. 

To me it just seems to not have that special something a red hook has without punt e e mes. The interplay between punt e mes and luxardo is the defining characteristic to me. But that's just me, and damn you seem to know your stuff too! I guess it's cool thaf weve reached a point cocktails are cool enough we can,have these lame arguments about them, lol",1583686058

* 2 ounces rye whiskey
* 1/2 ounce sweet vermouth (preferably Punt e Mes)
* 1/2 ounce maraschino liqueur
* Cocktail cherries (or lemon peel), for garnish

**Recipe**

* 2oz gin
* 1oz lemon juice
* .75oz rosemary simple syrup
* 3 strawberries, cut into smaller pieces &amp; muddled
* Shake &amp; double strain

The rosemary simple syrup was made by adding in a couple sprigs in while the syrup (1:1) was warm, the refrigerating for 2 days. I made another batch with ground clove &amp; ground cardamom, strained out after 2 days, that is awesome in a gin sour w/ egg white. That goes super well with Gin Mare (which has rosemary and thyme as it's main botanicals iirc).

Though not even in peak season, these strawberries were super sweet. Turned out such a gorgeous colour I had to post :)",1583655449

242,cocktails,"Sounds wonderful. 

Here's something else fun to try; a riff on a Sazerac and a Red Hook:

**Red Hook Sazerac**

*Recipe By:* Steve Cutchen

*Summary:* 

What happens when you drag a Sazerac out of New Orleans all the way to New York City? Well, you might end up in the Red Hook waterside enclave in south Brooklyn, creating a cross between a Red Hook cocktail and a New Orleans Sazerac. Start with the Sazerac, and add the Red Hook‚Äôs 1:4 ratio of sweet vermouth to the rye (the Red Hook‚Äôs nod to the Manhattan), and use the Red Hook‚Äôs Maraschino as a replacement for the Sazarac‚Äôs sugar. 

As it turns out, this cocktail is not a riff on either of its‚Äô ancestors. It is a wonderful cocktail that makes its own statement.

The Sazerac heritage brings Peychaud‚Äôs bitters and Herbsaint to the Red Hook, which deepens the cocktail and makes it much more interesting. 

The Red Hook heritage brings sweet vermouth and Maraschino to the Sazerac, which adds sweetness and fits really well with the anise and bitters.

Both a Sazerac and a Red Hook are served up, so this cocktail is as well. I chose the Red Hook‚Äôs stemmed Nick &amp; Nora glass rather than the Sazerac‚Äôs old fashioned glass.

*Ingredients:*

* 2 ounces rye
* 1/2 ounce sweet vermouth
* 1/2 ounce maraschino liqueur
* 1/4 ounce Herbsaint
* 3 dashes Peychaud‚Äôs bitters
* lemon twist

*Directions:*

1. Set a Nick &amp; Nora glass inside the freezer to chill.

2. Combine rye, sweet vermouth, Maraschino, and bitters in an iced mix glass and stir 40 rounds. 

3. Retrieve the Nick &amp; Nora glass and add the Herbsaint (or use a spray and thoroughly wet and puddle the inside). Strain in the cocktail.

4. Twist lemon peel over drink. Wipe the rim with it. Drop in the twist.",1583647889

**Recipe**

* A light beer (I use Beer from Garage Project)
* Snow chrysanthemum red tea
* Squeeze of lemon
* A slice of bacon

Add the first three ingredients to a Collins glass filled with ice, approximately half and half on the beer and tea. Thrust in the slice of crispy bacon and add a straw. Consider all the life choices that led you to this point. Serve!

**Tasting notes:** Kinda like a shandy I guess? Not as bad as you imagine but definitely not the best cocktail I‚Äôve had.

* .75 Fresh Lemon
* .75 Cointreau
* .75 Lillet Blanc (or to come closer to the classic flavor, you can sub  Kina L'Aero)

Mezcal - Naked and Famous:

* .75 Mezcal (Espadin, though you can use any Mezcal you want really, but different agave variants are going to have a very large impact on the outcome of the drink)
* .75 Aperol
* .75 Yellow Charteuse (I don't recommend going Green with this one, it will be far too floral. Yellow blends perfectly with the other ingredients without bullying them out)
* .75 Fresh Lime

Rye - Last Ward

* .75 Rye Whiskey (Michter's preferred, but Rittenhouse or even Old Overholt will do)
* .75 Luxardo Maraschino
* .75 Yellow Chartreuse (Again, no Green on this one - just make a Last Word instead)
* .75 Fresh Lemon

Any Amaro lovers out there can try one of mine:

* .75 Michter's Rye

428,cocktails,You know it‚Äôs not sold here in Russia anywhere. My friends brought me a bottle from USA. Maybe because I wanted to try it so badly but I really liked it even more than Hendrick‚Äôs and Bombay Sapphire,1583616643
429,cocktails,Ok boomer,1583616634
430,cocktails,"It will cut the sweetness better. 

Also no offense but that whiskey is kind of trash. I doubt its really bourbon, just whiskey",1583616539
431,cocktails,Yeah thats awful. Southern comfort is whiskey based but not whiskey,1583616431
432,cocktails,"Just go by taste. Most sangria recipes, if they have liquor added, use rum or brandy, which are gonna add more chatacter thsn a lemon vodka, which would realky just add lemon flavor and ABV. Is it actually lemon infused vodka and not lemon flavored vodka?",1583616283
433,cocktails,"Thanks for the advice. I‚Äôll try it next time. I‚Äôm not a barman, just making cocktails for myself and friends at home.",1583615893
434,cocktails,"If you're in Europe and looking for Bourbon, I highly recommend trying Pennypacker! (at least in Germany it's easy to find at Rewe)

12 Euros, and good enough to drink neat",1583615454
435,cocktails,I wouldn't ask this person any bartending questions. Their knowledge is a bit questionable,1583614924
436,cocktails,Well if you're learning to bartend from a spy novel you probably are quite inexperienced,1583614686
437,cocktails,"Word. I just feel like on the dry shake you spend so mucb time whipping up foam, only to dilute it with the wet shake. To me the opposite makes more sense. Dilute, chill, then foam",1583614608
438,cocktails,"Yeah i have no idea what they are talking about. I think they really thought cocchi Americano was from America, jaja",1583614512
439,cocktails,"I just think he has no idea what hes doing, cocktail wise. Or hes just a typical arrogant europeon, lol jk",1583614464
440,cocktails,Cool! Been doing a dry then wet shake til now Going to try this tonight with my whisky sour,1583614447
441,cocktails,Happy to help!,1583614444
442,cocktails,"Shake with ice first, then dry shake. I think its creates more, longet lasting foam, then the standard double shake",1583614370
443,cocktails,"I actually prefer using Amaro del Capo, it makes the drink less citrusy and more bitter",1583614215
444,cocktails,Reverse dry shake? I‚Äôm a noob. Please explain,1583614194
445,cocktails,You monster. Anyway I looked it up it's about 1/3 an ounce. Then discovered I actually have a jigger that is in cl.,1583614143
446,cocktails,Don't know what to tell ya bud!,1583614074
447,cocktails,"1 cl = 1 freedom unit 

Hope that helps üòò",1583613846
448,cocktails,Haha ok.,1583613606
449,cocktails,Funny story... Once I was a bit worse for wear and got my Southern USA whisky-type drinks confused. I asked a barman to make me a Godfather with Southern Comfort and Amaretto. That *really* was too sweet!!,1583613519
450,cocktails,What is that in freedom units?,1583613460
451,cocktails,"He's a cocktail troll, don't bother",1583613383

457,cocktails,"Yeah the product IN THE BOOK doesn't exist anymore dude, its not a hard concept to grasp. KINA LILLET IS DISCONTINUED.",1583612786
458,cocktails,Thanks. It was quite! I'll use scotch next time and compare.,1583612704
459,cocktails,"What? 
I‚Äôm using the original recipe from the book. 
Of course you can do what ever you wish. But don‚Äôt say Bond‚Äôs drink is different from the booküç∏",1583612670
460,cocktails,"He calls for kina lillet in the book, not lillet blanc, which is what you are using. Its a different product",1583612655
461,cocktails,"That doesn't mean it's good, lol. Also it tasted different 50 years ago, bro",1583612619
462,cocktails,"Cocchi Americano is made in Italy. That's why the ""can't spoil European cocktail like that"" part doesn't make any sense.",1583612558
463,cocktails,"If you read the book, you‚Äôll see what the original calls for.",1583612500
464,cocktails,"I'm not drunk at all?

You keep implying cocchi Americano has something to do with america, the xountry, and I'm not sure what patriotism has to do with anything?",1583612460
465,cocktails,"I don‚Äôt understand. 
How drunk are you right now?",1583612364
466,cocktails,"Gordons isnt that great, imo

It think it drinks too sweet with lillet, the Americano has a better bitterness.",1583612337
467,cocktails,Which vermouth are you using?,1583612321
468,cocktails,Sounds good then!,1583612237
469,cocktails,I dont understand what you mean? Patriotic? Cocchi Americano has nothing to do with america? What are you on about?,1583612175
470,cocktails,"Absolutely not.  It's one of those drinks I just have every once in awhile at a bar, because I don't want to buy the bottle of Nonino.  Also, if I bought the bottle, I'd just drink these and nothing else until it was gone.",1583612146
471,cocktails,"The book calls for Gordon‚Äôs, but I suppose sny London Gin Will do. 
However, don‚Äôt go with Cocchi. The Lillet is the Better choice. 
I‚Äôbe tried both.",1583612122
472,cocktails,"Oh, god no!!  I love Nonino and can't stand Montenegro.  I don't think they're similar at all.",1583612035
473,cocktails,Myself and many other bartenders I know definitely say recipe.,1583611979
474,cocktails,"I know. It‚Äôs a patriotic thing, but I guess that isn‚Äôt known in America, correct?",1583611923
475,cocktails,"Honestly they were just peppercorns I bought from the supermarket, so I wouldn't really know. As for the flavour, I didn't feel it overpowered the others, the spice from the peppercorns cut through a wee bit, and I needed the vermouth to be subtle after the initial pickle brine experience...",1583611905
476,cocktails,Bourbon in a godfather? I feel like that would drink a little too sweet,1583611781
477,cocktails,"What kind of gin did you use?

You should try it with cocchi Americano, its more authentic to Fleming's original recipe",1583611710
478,cocktails,"I'm not sure why that would spoil it, lol. It would actually be more authentic, since when ian Fleming created the drink lillet blanc didn't exist

Also you know Americano doesn't refer to the country of america, right? Its from italian amer, meaning bitter. Cocchi is from Italy, lol

Also europe is about 15 years behind the US when it comes to the cocktail game",1583611604
479,cocktails,"We have Lidl‚Äôs in the states, however alcohol laws are weird here and on a state by state basis. Grocery stores aren‚Äôt allowed to sell alcohol in my state. Gotta go to a special store for that.",1583611549
480,cocktails,"Word. Lillet blanc is too sweet for my palatte. The cocchi,will get you closer to how the original drink tasted",1583611328
481,cocktails,"So, I'm really just saying hi, as I've been lurking for several weeks, and have been loving all the posts and photography here (sorry for my low quality snap).

* 2 parts Bourbon
* 1 part Amaretto
* Ice and lemon peel

For those outside Europe, Lidl is a cheap, no nonsense grocery store with mostly own brand or off-brand items.

Today I bought various glasses from charity shops. Including a cup ready for the bourbon amaretto sour I saw on here. None of the glasses matched but they were all ¬£1 each. The glass pictured wasn't bought today. It's proper crystal.  Have a great weekend everyone.",1583611126
482,cocktails,Oh yeah! I have a crappy shaker right now. Can‚Äôt wait for the Elevated Craft Strainer I backed on Kickstarter to come!,1583610607
483,cocktails,"I've only had maybe four or five different ones, and this is not only my favorite but the most easily found.",1583610562
484,cocktails,"Yeah. Well Cocci Americanio is a common substitution, but I can‚Äôt spoil a European cocktail like that. 

But, you do you!",1583610482
485,cocktails,Read alongs,1583610285
486,cocktails,I prefer cocchi as well. Little extra quinine bitter bite! Whats that aquavit like? My state doesbt get too many varieties,1583610059
487,cocktails,Have you tried reverse dry shake? I switched about 3 years ago and haven't looked back,1583609944
488,cocktails,"Id be worried the espresso would,mute the other flavors? What kind of peppercorns? Just piper nigrum?",1583609897
489,cocktails,Don't forget to double strain! Lol,1583609837
490,cocktails,"I love the name of this drink, thanks for sharing the recipe, if it tastes as great as it looks I will be serving this at my next dinner party!",1583609575
491,cocktails,"Looks great! I dont like shaking it but you do you! Just like bond lol


Also When the drink was first created it used kina lillet. They discontinued that in 1987 for lillet blanc, which is sweeter and not as good for this drink, imo. I think using cocci Americano gets you closer to the original flavor profile, try it next time if you like!",1583609495
492,cocktails,"I love Ginger, so this is one beverage I am certainly going to try!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!  There are so many different flavors that this drink is probably outstanding.",1583609476
493,cocktails,"I would call that a stemless martini glass. Closest I can find on Amazon would be [this](https://www.amazon.com/Cocktail-Stemless-Cocktail-Housewarming-Celebrations/dp/B07JWGMM5H/), for example. That one has an unusually long bottom part, though.

0,cocktails,"I think fresh ingredients isn‚Äôt the best point to cheap out. I buy limes for 0.50$ a piece and get 1.5oz out of them, so enough for two of this (or many other) cocktails. This 25 cents are really worth it. 

I like to think: better a few really good cocktails with better/more expensive ingredients, than a lot that taste worse",1583608559
1,cocktails,Well get some Allen‚Äôs Coffee Brandy and Milk to make yourself a Maine Martini to forget about your state‚Äôs poor liquor options,1583608551
2,cocktails,Well then im very happy to see our gins touching other countries this much,1583608356
3,cocktails,"I agree, just tough to justify the cost/oz when i go through so much of it! I also don't have a proper juicer yet, need to pick up either a swing arm or clamshell citrus juicer at some point.",1583608251
4,cocktails,"I tried two variations. One that was a bit more haphazard, and this one. Obviously it took a damn long time to get it just right. 

Thinking back I should have just done three peppercorns to replicate the etiquette of a espresso martini.",1583608125
5,cocktails,"So there's a place I like to swing by when I get the chance called Pastrami and Rye, great sandwiches, great coffee, great pickles. I really wanted to evoke those flavours in a drink for some reason. 

First there's the name, something I can handle in one ingredient. The pastrami I'm used to is peppered, and thankfully there's rye whiskey so peppercorn infused rye whiskey was the ticket. Coffee also paired well, but the the pickle? Well first I tried actual pickle brine, just to see. It wasn't BAD but it certainly wasn't good. I decided on Dry Vermouth and Saline, to sort of cover the vinegar and salt that would make up a lot of your typical pickle brine. The result was pretty dang tasty, at least to me. A little odd, but fun for sure. 

Recipe

* 1.5 oz Peppercorn infused Rye Whiskey
* 2 oz Espresso Coffee
* 0.5 oz Dry Vermouth
* 1 dash Saline Solution

Shake it all together, garnish with whole peppercorns, and enjoy.

Bitters?

The daiquiri turned out good.

Did not have the same results at another place when I asked for a Caipirinha.",1583598832
57,cocktails,"It definitely gave it a sort of silkier texture, makes the citrus a little less puckering too. I think you could definitely use a little more vodka and still get an even tasting cocktail. Most of the recipes for the Evita that I‚Äôve seen use equal vodka/melon liqueur which I think lets the melon stand out a little bit more which I enjoy, but I‚Äôm never opposed to a stronger drink",1583598811

I have no idea of the veracity of this (or whether it was incorrectly translated to English) but I was planning to try it at some point. Or I will eventually get around to reverse engineering a vape pen sometime and just buy the bubble solution from the Flavor Blaster company.

It kind of reminds me how back \~10 years ago people were making their own smoking guns (which could be done with 15$ of parts, I made my own) after it was determined the 100$+ smoking gun was just a mini vacuum.

I do fancy it but to be honest it obtained more awards for it's look than it's array of flavour. Hence, that one being quite ""neutral"", if you already think it is too pronounced on the juniper, I would disagree with some comments advising you for a Plymouth Gin, because that one is not as dry but on the other hand it holds a way sharper and richer taste of juniper berries.

My suggestion : give a try to an Old Tom Gin. It's also a very nice gin which was people's favourite during the 1700's, and you might preferred it because it holds a hint of sweetness rather than a strong juniper flavour which might make it more palatable to you eventually.

Stick with simple classics for the cocktail trial, like a gin and tonic as you did or an aviation for example. It'll be easier to ""feel"" the gin and sort out if you fancy it or not.

The spec was to create a variation of a classic cocktail using Tanqueray 10, championing its famous Citrus Heart with a citrus forward drink!

This is my spin on a classic Gin Flip that fuses my love for that drink with my love for Key Lime Pie!!

45ml Butter Fat Washed Tanqueray 10
25ml Key Lime Juice
25ml Oleo Saccharum
2tsp Citrus Sugar
1 Whole Medium Egg
50 Chlorophyll, Yuzu Sake and Tanqueray 10 infused Reverse Spherification Popping Balls

For wetware: homemake your simple (no need to buy), fresh squeeze your citrus just ahead of cocktails, get bitters as most classics need bitters (Angastora and/or Peyshaud), vermouth (both sweet and dry), and maybe triple sec of some sort.

No need to go crazy up front from my point of view. Take time, build your bar, and find your taste profile. Experiment with new and wonderful recipes and booze over time. I would recommend starting with the classics first.

398,cocktails,"You probably won't have much choice - most bars/clubs I've been to typically only stock one or two brands. Most ciders you can order are 6.9% ABV (assuming you are in the US), which makes them just a tad stronger than light beer, and half as strong as a typical wine.

If by ""weak"" you mean ""prone to getting too drunk"" or ""I'll get wicked hangovers,"" there is a cure for that! All alcohol is alcohol, as they say, and vodka or whiskey or any other spirit at the same proof will have exactly the same effect. The reason we get too drunk or get hangovers is almost entirely down to dehydration, not the type of spirit we're drinking.

So if you can get in the habit of having a glass of water between each drink, you'll be able to go for longer without getting hella blitzed, and you'll be far less likely to be hungover the next morning.

P.S. if you like tropical flavors, pineapple cider is the bee's knees! Fingers crossed that they have it wherever you end up, it's super tasty and very light.",1583523650

21,cocktails,"This one is just a classic Philadelphia Fish House Punch riff fit into a milk-punch template. ""(Reserve)"" means it's a clear ingredient I add to the finished product (or before the last pass through the filter) to reflavor it. The basic recipe is very dry, and you add the liqueurs and reserved oleo at the end until it's to your liking.

  

3 parts Jamaican rum

2 parts cognac or armagnac

1 parts rhum agricole

1.5 parts peach liqueur (reserve‚Äîadd to taste)

.5 parts pear liqueur (reserve‚Äîadd to taste)

1 to 2.5 parts oleo syrup (reserve half‚Äîadd to taste)

.5 parts pear brandy (optional)

2.5 lemon juice 

1.5 lime juice

5.5 parts tea

4 parts milk

&amp;#x200B;

Steps:

1. Use the Jamaican rum, armagnac, and citrus to curdle blood-temperature whole milk
2. Add curdled mixture to pot containing tea, 1 part oleo, rhum agricole. Stir and let sit.
3. Begin filtration (I use a system of nested colanders of decreasing pore size, which is slightly speedier)
4. It will usually take at least two passes. Once it's clear, you can add the liqueurs and reserved oleo to taste. You can also adjust for acid using powdered acids (I prefer malic because the dryness works well with the astringency of the tea). I'm wary of adding strong spirits at this stage because they'll overpower everything else and you'll have to pass through the curds again to soften them.

Good luck!",1583506295

128,cocktails,A lot of cocktails using absinthe/pernod call for rinsing the glass. Best advice I could give you is to hold on to it and build up to recipes calling for that.

200,cocktails,"If you're interested this is the recipe I used last time:


6-9 lemons

1 orange

1 meyer lemon

Everclear 95%


Peel the fruit using a potato peeler (you want wide strips not tiny zests) and use a paring knife to cut away any white pith. Place the peels in the everclear and store in a dark place at room temperature. Infuse for 4-7 days(I did 4). Add simple syrup to taste(I wanted mine a little strong so I did a 2/3 ratio base to simple syrup so it ended up around 40% abv. If you want the traditional 20% go 1/4) and infuse for 24 hours. Strain out the peels and let the liqueur sit for 10 days at room temperature. Refrigerate and serve chilled.


I should also note I infused the simple syrup with a little elderflower and lavendar but that was an addition I made all on my own and competely optional. You could infuse any flavor you think could enhance your drink.",1583453792

214,cocktails,"Happy to help. The recipes for milk punches vary pretty widely, and you can also fit any existing cocktail into a milk-punch template. Here are a few rules I generally live by:

‚ÄîAcid content should be between 0.50% and 1.00%.   
‚ÄîABV should be between 10% and 20%; a big range, but I find most sit comfy around 15%. If it's on the lower end, it may taste thin, so consider adding gas (CO2 or N2O).  
‚ÄîThe more cloudy ingredients you use, the more volume you will lose, since the phenolic compounds that cause cloudiness will be filtered out. They have mass, hence less volume in the finished drink. Expect to lose about 20% of your input volume. Adjust your spec accordingly (proportion of sugar, alcohol, and acid will be higher in the output than input)  
‚ÄîMilk washing strips out basically everything: flavonoids (which, of course, are the source of lots of flavor) are phenolic compounds, so you'll lose them. So this is really a process that's only worth doing on cheap ingredients. I try to spend less than $25 on average on every 750ml bottle that goes into a punch.  
‚ÄîMost milk punches call for typical 18th-century Atlantic colonial trade ingredients, like fortified wine, cane sugar, pineapple. Don't feel constrained by these.  
‚ÄîWhole milk is 15% protein by volume (or thereabout), so calculate this as an immediate output volume loss.  
‚ÄîWine is really strong tasting compared to liquor. Since it's low ABV there's more room in its volume for flavor compounds. Use it sparingly in milk punches or they'll just taste like flavored wine.  
‚ÄîTry ""reflavoring"" your finished punch with clear ingredients: tinctures, hydrosols, and liqueurs. Most milk punches taste pretty similar (muted, silky); this is a way to get them to stand out.",1583452722

2. This is not a kamikaze, in neither ingredients or proportions. A kamikaze is a vodka daisy daisys are sours,that are sweetened with liqueur,instead of,sugar syrup. A kamikaze usually has vodka, triple sec and lime juice, usually in a 2:1:1 proportion, which is about what a sour ratio should be. 2 parts spirit, 1 part sweet, 1 part sour, like a whiskey sour, or a daiquiri. For daiquiri I,prefer 2:1:.75 but whatever.

 This drinks ratios are 1.5 spirit, 1.75 sweet, .75 sour. An awful, awful ratio. Why would you want more,sugar than spirit? Even when I worked at shitty clubs the ratio for,kamikazes was 1:1:1, which is better than this

Probably didn‚Äôt need to use a expensive vodka but it‚Äôs what I currently had on hand. Blueberry simple syrup was made with whole berries thrown into the pot with equal amounts of sugar and water. Let them simmer until the juices come over. Strain and macerate. That‚Äôs the key to the cloud appearance which is the inside of the berry. Shake and serve into a coupe and sprinkle the stars over top. I‚Äôd recommend then gently stirring to get the visual effect right and distribute them around.

Cuba Libre is a pretty good one, just a rum and coke with lime juice but I find that helps balance out the sweetness and potential hangover.

Dark and Stormy is another easy one, ginger beer and dark rum sometimes with lime juice and/or simple syrup. It acts a bit spicy/tingly but is really refreshing.

Personally I love mojitos but if they‚Äôre busy or don‚Äôt serve them a lot I‚Äôd stay away. Generally most places don‚Äôt carry fresh mint and it takes more effort which can lead to bartenders cutting corners leading to a pretty shit drink.",1583391367

456,cocktails,"Sparkling water shouldn't effect flavor too much, but it's typically very lightly carbonated, so when added to a cocktail doesn't do much for effervescence.

Tonic water contains quinine, which is a bittering agent, so it will add quite a bit of bitterness to a cocktail, which can be desirable depending on what you're trying to do. It's also UV reactive, which can be fun.

Seltzer will have a very slight bitterness to it just because of the co2 content, but in most cocktails wouldn't effect flavor too much. Highly carbonated

3,cocktails,"So this is called an Asterisk. Yet another Last Word variant, this one using Cognac in place of gin. It gives a much sweeter, dessert wine style cocktail, almost getting to the sweet factor of a margarita, but more herbaceous and complex. It could possibly use a dash of salt to balance out the high sweetness, but as it's the first time I made it, I'm enjoying the light profile of this drink. 

I'll admit though, I didn't exactly follow the recipe for an Asterisk, as indicated on [this blog here.](https://cold-glass.com/2011/04/01/the-last-word-with-an-asterisk-variations-on-a-classic-cocktail/) It's a good recipe, but I've got a bottle of Yellow Chartreuse I'm trying to make more drinks with. 

Mine is as follows:

* 3/4oz Lemon Juice (I used a fresh Meyer lemon off my tree, which is a sweeter, less tart lemon)
* 3/4oz Maraschino
* 3/4oz Yellow Chartreuse (the recipe called for Green, but I wanted a mellower profile to my dessert cocktail)
* 3/4oz Camus VSOP Cognac
* Combine and shake over ice

It's definitely a sweet after dinner drink. Less immediately quaffable, due to the sweeter, almost syrupy mouthfeel. I like it a lot, but I might try using a tarter lemon next time, or maybe dial down the Maraschino to a 1/2oz.

Edit: Reading the blog comments, it's close to a Last Dance, which is equal parts Yellow Chartreuse, Maraschino, Lemon, and Armagnac. Armagnac is relatively similar in profile to Cognac, so it would give a drink staggeringly close to mine.",1583380329

One from this site:
https://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2015/03/27/resurrecting-creme-de-cacao-two-diy-chocolate-liqueurs

And the second from this YouTube channel:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDxuyevYys

I did the following:

Take storage vessel,jar or bottle(sterilized) 

Put 1 cup (by volume) of *toasted cacao nibs

Half of star anise 

5 cloves 

6 allspice berries

Half vanilla bin(with a knife extract the vanilla seeds, and discard the vanilla bin) 

I used half a bottle of 40 ABV vodka (about 375ml)

After I inserted everything inside the sterilized bottle I closed it and put in closet for 14 days. every time I happened to walk by I shaked the bottle. 

After 14 days I fine strained the liquid and then strained through **coffee filter to remove the cacao butter. 

Then I poured it into another sterilized bottle and added demerara syrup (about 100 ml water and 40-50 grams of sugar) . 
And voil√† you've got Cr√®me de cacao.

For some reason after I strained it I was left with only about 200-220 ml of infused vodka. Maybe it evaporated because of the shaking or because I opened the bottle a couple of times while infusing. That's why I used so little sugar in addition to the fact I wanted it to be bitter and not to sweet. You can add more/less sugar or water(dilution)  to your liking. 
The spices add an interesting background to the rich and bitter taste of caco nibs. 

* I used  raw caco nibs that I toasted for a few seconds on a skillet until they became more brown and you could smell the chocolate aroma coming out. Be aware to not burn them. 

** Straining through a coffee filter really changes the looks of your Cr√®me de cacao. It turns it flow muddy brown to a beautiful dark red/black colour and you get rid of all the foam that you get for the cacao butter.  Be aware that straining through coffee filter will take a long time. While straining I changed a few times the coffee filters as they got clogged from the cacao butter. 
And also before straining through the coffee filter, rinse the coffee filter with some hot water to clean the paper and to get rid of the papery taste you might get.

103,cocktails,"The following is a compilation of thoughts I had on the drink last week going back and forth in another thread. This was originally directed at someone far more dismissive, so if there's a slightly sarcastic tone, it's not directed at you, I promise

...


Egg white has a lot of textural reasons across a number of drinks. I love egg whites. The best selling cocktail at my bar has egg white. It's especially great in a well balanced classic whiskey sour. It's heavenly. I'm with you! 

Red wine also has a textural sensation that is rather different. You take the creaminess of egg white and immediately dry it out with tannins, which is counterintuitive. I mean, no one has ever had a perfect whiskey sour and said ""This drink is way too silky, I really wish their was some graininess to balance this out."" You could use a low tannin wine like a Gamay, but then the color is lighter and ithe flavor gets run over by the whiskey, so you're kinda priced into using at least a medium bodied red.

Then you take the beautiful, rich, fruity bouquet of a great red wine and hide it under the the neutral, ""soon to be wet dog if you don't drink this shit fast enough"" of whipped egg white. Sure, you could add a few drops of bitters, but I'd rather smell the wine, seeing that it is the defining element of the drink. Then you have to sink it through the foam, and you get this little purple tapeworm looking thing in the middle of the drink for your trouble. You can swirl it, but I'd rather see a nice, clean layered drink than a rush job to cover up your wine splooge.

So you spend all this time and energy working to make this beautiful, taste drink, then make the texture worse, mute the nose, and ruin the clean foam on the top of the drink.

Drink what you like, by all means, but when you start asking yourself why you're adding this egg white to the drink... The cons (to me) far outweigh the sole positive of ""If you shoot it at the right angle, it looks great on Instagram"".

And arguably most important, there is no historical basis for egg white, but rather the opposite. The drink falls around 1880's Chicago (aka the Continental Sour or Southern Whiskey Sour) and was simply a classic sour ""with a claret snap"". Which would also indicate the historical correctness of pouring a more Bordeaux style wine, while possibly not Bordeaux itself. [Insert the ""classic sours have egg white"" comment] which is true, but the practice dates to more the 1900's, and particularly ascribed to a book from 1922). There was even a name for the few who chose to add egg white and red wine (Brunswick Sour) ... Which you don't hear about much because history has a way of self-correcting itself.

Now if you consider all these factors and determine that a.) you don't care, it looks awesome or b.) the internet guy is wrong and fuck him... then serve it however you like. This is just why I find the egg white addition to be wrong from a reasoned perspective. Cheers!",1583351423

I also picked up a Martini brand vermouth, but I picked up the extra dry. I'm looking forward to trying it but I'm not expecting much. I've read maybe 15 cocktail books in the last year and not a single one calls for or even mentions the brand. 

In the world of distilled spirits high proof means high flavor, but a strength of vermouth is the flavor it has despite the relatively low proof. For this reason I find a vodka martini to be maybe a bit redundant, but I've not had one before so I'm gonna save the judgements for my palate, just maybe after I make a standard gin martini, because I've not had one of those either.",1583343381

\-Bitter, like grape skins

\-Fuller, sweeter

2 oz Rye or Bourbon (I used Sazerac Rye)

1 oz Sweet Vermouth (I used Carpano Antica

1 dash Aromatic bitters (Angostura)

1 dash Orange bitters (Angostura Orange)

Garnish Amarena or Marasca cherry,  or lemon twist (Luxardo)

Tl;dr I had a bad vermouth experience. I thought all vermouth wasn't my thing. A year later I try a better vermouth and it is delicious.

So with that out of the way, I have to gush a little bit. This is my first Vermouth cocktail. Or rather my third. Last year when I was first getting into cocktail culture I quickly stumbled into this book Death &amp; Co. I tried making some cocktails, some better than others, something I tried was a few dry and sweet Vermouth cocktails. After foraging around online I had found that many people were calling Dolin a great place to start in vermouths. To let you know how that went, I dont even remember what my first two cocktails with vermouth were. All I remember is one was with dry and one was with sweet. I tried them on their own and was quite honestly disgusted. Vermouth wasn't for me. That was about a year ago. Fast forward to last week. After a year of avoiding the aromatic variety of cocktails entirely I do something uncharacteristic. I find and read through a book on bitters. After adding a small handful of bitters to my collection and trying them out I find my mind opening up to the idea of vermouths again. This time I do a bit of research and look back at some words Death &amp; Co had on a particular sweet vermouth: ""equally delicious on it's own"" ""full bodied flavor profile"" I am now a proud owner of a bottle of Carpano and honestly everything they say about it is true. If St. Germain is ketchup, Carpano is Frank's red hot.""I put that shit on everything"". and honestly I'm excited to.",1583298124

256,cocktails,"The cocktail actually started quite differently. We needed a cocktail for valentines day and a server recommended something with spicy cinnamon syrup to resemble candy hearts. I played with the idea a bit but it just wasn't working and so I ended up doing a different drink for valentines day. This cocktail sat on the backburner for a couple weeks until a slow night where I had time to play around with it. It started out as a white rum tiki cocktail with no drambuie, actually. It had white rum and benedictine and no vermouth. It was also lengthened with soda and had no bitters. It was pretty gross. It needed less sugar based spirits and more botanicals. I replaced the rum with gin. I then felt that the cinnamon syrup wasn't being highlighted by the benedictine so I swapped out out for drambuie as the baking spice, malted oak, and honey notes really assisted the cinnamon syrup. Lengthening it with syrup sucked - it just diluted it far too much. Dilution felt necessary when it was unbalanced but it was a burden in the newly balanced drink so I just cut out the soda. It felt like it was missing some body which in this case a splash of red vermouth assisted. I played with different quantities of vermouth, port, and other fortified wine such as dubonnet, but the vermouth just worked well. 

I'd say the main thing if you want to get into creating completely original cocktails is to start by modifying existing cocktails. Swap out one ingredient at a time so you fully understand the role it played in that drink. Once you are familiar with your ingredients and the niches they can fill in cocktails that you already know are balanced, you'll have a better idea of what ingredients play nice with each other. You'll also start to have an idea of what's missing from a cocktail or what you'd prefer in a cocktail. If you have a sip and go ‚Äùtoo sweet‚Äù you'll know which ingredients are causing the sweetness and can adjust thereafter. It just comes with practice.

I'd recommend playing around with the Last Word. It's a 4 ingredient cocktail thats very easy to modify. Also never underestimate the power of an honest friend who will let you get them tipsy for the sake of science.",1583295082

Not having any Yellow Chartreuse on hand, taking /u/deterraformer's [advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/fc3jk7/paper_plane/fjacs5f), I directly subbed it with Benedictine, which produced also a delicious drink, but probably in my next try I'll amp up the Benedictine a little but since I thought it got slightly overpowered by the mezcal.

302,cocktails,"You could easily make a tincture - essentially an extract. Char your corn (best not to use any oil) and let it sit in high proof vodka or Everclear in a sealed jar, then strain and filter to get your charred corn tincture. I usually fill up a tiny 4oz Mason jar halfway with material and then fill to the top with the spirit. The higher the proof of your alcohol, the less time it will take/the more flavor you'll get. Best practice is to keep in a cool dark area and shake every other day; start tasting after about two weeks and let it infuse to your preferred strength. 

If you don't know what a tincture is: Bitters are tinctures of multiple botanicals, but it's not called a bitters when it's only one flavor. I've always had great luck with them.",1583283853

So, imagine my surprise when few weeks ago, I‚Äôve read that dry Vermouth goes bad in 6 months even refrigerated! I made drinks that tasted just fine in the past few months, so I decided I‚Äôd test the theory. So here it is - 10 year bottle of Martini dry Vermouth, and a brand new, just opened bottle of Noilly Prat. 

First test was the smell. They both smell like sweet white wine, but the old bottle definitely had a bit more sour smell - hardly overwhelming though. It felt like a difference between a cheap bottle of wine and a nice bottle of wine. 

Second test was the taste. I started with the Noilly Prat. Unsurprisingly, it tasted like a slightly fortified wine (18% alcohol content). Martini tasted very similar at 16% alcohol content. You could definitely tell it was supposed to be a similar drink, but it did have a sour taste to it. Again, far from really bad and really unpleasant - again more like cheap wine and nice wine. 

So, in the end, I dumped the Martini down the drain and stored the Noilly Prat in the fridge. It seems that dry Vermouth really does go bad, but in all honesty, the difference between the old and the new was almost negligible to me. The stories I‚Äôve read made me think I‚Äôd vomit old vinegar flavored drink - in reality it was just a slightly sourish wine taste. 

That is it for today‚Äôs totally unscientific test!",1583273411

I experimented with between .75 and 1.5 and found it's really personal preference at that point - 1.5 gets you a super sexy foam but made the body of the drink a little slimy for my taste, but some of my friends really liked that ratio so I'd say play with a little more and see what you like. 1 was my personal favourite by far. Letting the aquafaba sit in the lemon juice for a couple minutes before shaking + mixing whole and cracked ice for the shake (if you're not already) is how I find I get the most foam!",1583271285
392,cocktails,"Just mix it with some rum and citrus and you‚Äôre good to go. If you want to make more complex tiki cocktails, I‚Äôd suggest to diy the ingredients, as that‚Äôs an easier and cheaper way to obtain most of them.

489,cocktails,"Oh, I agree 100 percent. I was just responding to the comment that ""variations are fine, but the original is fine."" Just thought that was funny considering the drink in question is a gin Old Fashioned.",1583246839
